article= <d> <p> <s>  Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader  Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators  to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's  destruction. </s> <s>  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile,  said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots  with a firm hand. </s> <s>  He added that he would not go ahead with a West  Bank troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement,  unless Arafat met a list of demands. </s> <s>  The West Bank has been swept  by stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians  marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone  mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. </s> <s>   The violence raised concern that U.S. </s> <s>  President Bill Clinton's visit  to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more  unrest rather than calming the already tense situation. </s> <s>  Israeli hard-liners,  including Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring  statehood status on the Palestinian areas. </s> <s>  On Thursday, signs reading  Clinton go home were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway  and on walls in Jerusalem. </s> <s>  The most problematic moment of the Clinton  visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council,  the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups,  in Gaza City. </s> <s>  Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during  this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of  the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. </s> <s>   Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians  say only approval by acclamation is required. </s> <s>  Netanyahu said Thursday  he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton  declares the PNC session a success without it. </s> <s>  It is Israel which  determines issues connected with its future, Netanyahu said when  asked by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown  with Clinton over the issue. </s> <s>  It is unlikely the U.S. </s> <s>  president would  side with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the  main purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement,  had failed. </s> <s>  Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer  five percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint jurisdiction. </s> <s>   Netanyahu said last week he was freezing the pullback over what he  claimed were systematic Palestinian violations of the peace accord. </s> <s>   He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless  Arafat publicly dropped plans to unilaterally declare a Palestinian  state in May. </s> <s>  The prime minister's critics have said he is seizing  excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he faces  a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down  the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. </s> <s>  The Palestinians,  meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord. </s> <s>  On Thursday,  98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's  seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat  letter concerning the PLO charter. </s> <s>  The meeting is an interim step,  ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. </s> <s>   A simple majority of 63 members is required, and a vote was expected  by Thursday evening. </s> <s>  The council has not met for years and was revived  specifically for Thursday's vote. </s> <s>  It consists of PNC delegates, members  of the Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee,  among others. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> West Bank stone-throwing protests. </s> <s>  Vote on revoking clause biggest problem. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
