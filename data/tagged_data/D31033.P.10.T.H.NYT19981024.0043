article= <d> <p> <s>  Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy? </s> <s>  Until  last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft  Corp. </s> <s> , as a genius and innovator. </s> <s>  A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled  visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal  computer. </s> <s>  Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice  Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. </s> <s>  In  an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man  whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal  computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian schemer  who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. </s> <s>  Product  innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. </s> <s>   Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition  and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the  government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of  payments by the Microsoft chairman. </s> <s>  It also sought to cast Gates as  an obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. </s> <s>   and its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet  browsers, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. </s> <s>  Gates  was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard  bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness  that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator  and high-technology guru. </s> <s>  According to a document presented by Boies,  for example, Gates asked America Online executives in 1996: How  much do we need to pay you to damage Netscape? </s> <s>  This is your lucky  day. </s> <s>  The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant,  and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes  as many offers you can't refuse as needed to achieve its goals. </s> <s>   Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint  that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from  the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public  will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive  business tactics and the company's software. </s> <s>  Despite what you're  reading in the press, people judge us by our products, said Mich  Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. </s> <s>  Our  experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks. </s> <s>  So far, consumers  are casting positive votes. </s> <s>  Last week Microsoft reported quarterly  profits of $1. </s> <s> 52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the  level a year earlier. </s> <s>  Despite the record profits, some marketing experts  say that if the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style  robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. </s> <s>  When you  have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really  the driver of the brand, said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert  at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at  Berkeley. </s> <s>  There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's  brand recognition. </s> <s>  Already there are early warning signals, as political  cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. </s> <s>   One showed him holding a globe and saying, If you don't play my  way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portrayed the Microsoft  chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window  while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, I'm sorry, but Mr.  Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows. </s> <s>  But some industry  analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play  hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. </s> <s>  The he-said,  she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases  both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked  in a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc. </s> <s> , is viewed  by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that  goes on in professional sports. </s> <s>  It's like taking what Charles Barkley  and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court and turning  it into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews,  co-author with Stephen Manes of Gates (Doubleday, 1993). </s> <s>  Indeed,  there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has  so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon  Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates'  tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. </s> <s>   In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity. </s> <s>   Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students  at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's  suit was roundly booed. </s> <s>  BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. </s> <s>  Times  News Service Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No.  1 or a threat to the known universe? </s> <s>  All three, judging from the numerous  political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country  last week. </s> <s>  From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in  demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge  as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. </s> <s>  Other cartoons  ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium  in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones, saying to some  visitors, Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department)  to the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen  staring at the words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. </s> <s>   Leave your possessions. </s> <s>  Go to the desert. </s> <s>  Await the spaceship). </s> <s>   And that was just Week One of the trial. </s> <s>  Stay tuned. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Justice Paints a Dark Portrait of Gates in Microsoft Antitrust Suit. </s> </p> </d>
