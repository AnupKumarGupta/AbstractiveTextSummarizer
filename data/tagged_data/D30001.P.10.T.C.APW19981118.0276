article= <d> <p> <s>  Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom  of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they  will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. </s> <s>  The assurances  were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun  Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. </s> <s>  offices  in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind  a plot against his life. </s> <s>  Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament  from his party have been holed up overseas for two months. </s> <s>  But a deal  reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,  on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their  return. </s> <s>  In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father  and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday,  Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied  to all politicians. </s> <s>  His assurances come a week before the first session  of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. </s> <s>  Sam Rainsy said  Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. </s> <s>  He said it contained  indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy  Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling  party. </s> <s>  It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members  of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,'  the opposition leader said in a statement. </s> <s>  But instead they make  roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited  by a legal system that is completely in their control. </s> <s>  Ranariddh  told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy  in Cambodia. </s> <s>  Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok,  the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning  of ministries in the new coalition government. </s> <s>  Last week, Hun Sen's  Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to  form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and  make the prince president of the National Assembly. </s> <s>  The deal assures  the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. </s> <s>   The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh  in a coup last year. </s> <s>  I think Hun Sen has got everything. </s> <s>  He's got  the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition  from his majesty the king. </s> <s>  I don't think there is any benefit for  Hun Sen to cause instability for our country, Ranariddh said. </s> <s>  The  prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be  given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in  the Cambodian military's general staff. </s> <s>  Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered  forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to  last year's coup. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Hun Sen Guarantees safety and freedom to fearful rivals in exile. </s> </p> </d>
