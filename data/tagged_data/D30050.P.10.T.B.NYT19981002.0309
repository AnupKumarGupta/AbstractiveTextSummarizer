article= <d> <p> <s>  In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said  Friday that he must live with the consequences of his mistakes,  although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements  of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. </s> <s>  Clinton has  stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has  taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before  moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans'  needs. </s> <s>  He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. </s> <s>  In one deft sentence,  he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's  economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support  in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. </s> <s>  After thanking the  gathered donors for the very kind personal things they had said  to him, the president declared, If I had to do it all over again,  every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is  today as compared to six years ago. </s> <s>  As the applause died away, Clinton  continued, I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live  with the consequences of our mistakes in life. </s> <s>  He added with a chuckle:  Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. </s> <s>   But nobody gets out of life for free. </s> <s>  To the music of a saxophone  and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch  in a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate  in Ohio, Mary Boyle. </s> <s>  Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a  million dollars for the Democratic Party. </s> <s>  By midsummer, the president's  aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising  remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. </s> <s>   But as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached,  his free-form remarks have become longer. </s> <s>  In Cleveland on Friday,  he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost  20 minutes. </s> <s>  These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since  Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. </s> <s>  17. </s> <s>  He is lauded,  applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors. </s> <s>  Mr. President,  these are your friends here today, said Tony George, the host of  the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played  a similar role. </s> <s>  But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were  scattered along the president's motorcade route were reminders of  calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some  are heaping upon his presidency. </s> <s>  At a rally for the president outside  city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, two more  years. </s> <s>  Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds  of people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. </s> <s>   After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with  shouts of We love you, Clinton told some donors at the beginning  of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: I didn't even  mind the protesters, that's the American way. </s> <s>  But, he added, he  preferred it when they were in the minority, and that seemed to  be the case. </s> <s>  As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard  for a local radio station, WNCX. </s> <s>  Lovin', touchin', squeezin',  it read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with  his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside  them. </s> <s>  The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly  to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. </s> <s>  Instead,  in his remarks, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency  about addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of  struggling farmers and schoolchildren. </s> <s>  As he typically does now before  such partisan audiences, he also walked through his political calculation  for the mid-term elections. </s> <s>  Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans  had bragged privately to him about their prospects. </s> <s>  They tell me,  `Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms  because we have so much more money than you do,' and because Democrats  who turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in  an off-year. </s> <s>  That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton  from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote. </s> <s>  But he often goes  further than that, saying that his predicament could actually help  the Democrats. </s> <s>  Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not  bother to vote in a typical election. </s> <s>  The people that were good  enough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of  hassles in their life, he said. </s> <s>  But, he said, adversity is our  friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus us on what is  at issue here. </s> <s>  What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements  and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. </s> <s>   What have they done? </s> <s>  he asked in Cleveland. </s> <s>  They killed the  minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. </s> <s>  They killed campaign  finance reform. </s> <s>  They killed the tobacco reform legislation. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Clinton supports candidates, speaks at fundraisers, acknowledges
