article= <d> <p> <s>  As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball  Association and its players is weird even by sports standards. </s> <s>  There  is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season  will be canceled. </s> <s>  In this union battle it is the interests of the  best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the  discussion. </s> <s>  And here it is some of the workers, not the management,  who are considering trying to make the union disappear. </s> <s>  The current  arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. </s> <s>   Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum,  then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans. </s> <s>  The number of  players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class,  in NBA terms _ fell sharply. </s> <s>  But Michael Jordan made $33 million. </s> <s>   This should not be a surprise. </s> <s>  Sports is an entertainment business,  not unlike movies. </s> <s>  Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. </s> <s>   Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. </s> <s>   The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its  own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. </s> <s>  When that was adopted,  it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could  pay. </s> <s>  But it has not worked out that way. </s> <s>  In the current negotiation,  the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20  percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1. </s> <s> 2 billion,  and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players  want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises  for veterans. </s> <s>  The union says it is worried about that middle class,  but seems determined to preserve the free market. </s> <s>  The league got its  broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay  this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to  broadcast. </s> <s>  (They will be paid back in later years, either through  reduced fees or extra games to show. </s> <s> ) Owners hoped the players would  think management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with  only a small part of the season canceled. </s> <s>  But the union is acting  unhurried. </s> <s>  It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying  the players had to meet first. </s> <s>  Then there is the issue of union suicide,  a tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995. </s> <s>  The idea is that  if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws  for the owners to collude. </s> <s>  The sky would be the limit. </s> <s>  That tactic  might fail. </s> <s>  The courts could reject a union decertification vote as  a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel  free to offer less than the old union minimum. </s> <s>  But if the players  go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get  going. </s> <s>  Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners  this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. </s> <s>   That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World  Series was canceled by labor troubles. </s> <s>  But fan memories are relatively  short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever. </s> <s>  With that in  mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Union minimum, Jordan, free agent, payroll rise, lockout, union suicide. </s> </p> </d>
