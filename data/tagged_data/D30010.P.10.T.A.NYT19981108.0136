article= <d> <p> <s>  On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left  for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye  to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. </s> <s>  Relatives  say that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village near Jerusalem  showed no sign that he was heading for a suicide mission with his  brother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. </s> <s>  Their  car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, killing  both men and wounding 24 people. </s> <s>  Don't grieve for me, he wrote  in a farewell note, according to relatives who found it later. </s> <s>  If  you cry, cry with happiness that I'm a martyr. </s> <s>  Don't serve bitter  coffee, serve sweets. </s> <s>  I'm going to Paradise. </s> <s>  At the family's stone  house outside Jerusalem on Sunday, visitors paying condolence calls  were served sweet juice, not coffee, as Sughayer's relatives tried  to make sense of what he had done. </s> <s>  The young man, once an ace student,  had come of age in Israeli prisons. </s> <s>  Jailed for a year at age 15 for  stoning Israeli cars during the riots of the Palestinian uprising,  he was imprisoned again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years  for similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. </s> <s>  Relatives  said he was an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by Islamic militants  with whom he was jailed. </s> <s>  Sughayer came out of prison more devout,  and hardened by mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis, relatives  said. </s> <s>  His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about  the glories of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer. </s> <s>  They  sowed it in his heart, he said. </s> <s>  He wanted to be a martyr in the  cause of God. </s> <s>  But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, was not  so apparent when Sughayer was freed seven months ago. </s> <s>  He seemed  normal, said his brother. </s> <s>  He went to work at the grocery store,  he finished his high school classes and he wanted to enroll in the  university. </s> <s>  He was supposed to take a driving test in a few days. </s> <s>   If he was planning something, we didn't see it. </s> <s>  He would stay up  late at night after work, studying the Koran and praying, but he showed  no outward signs of rage toward Israel. </s> <s>  He would joke about things  and say that whatever happens is God's will, said a brother-in-law,  who insisted on anonymity. </s> <s>  He was an easygoing guy. </s> <s>  Last Thursday,  Sughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it near his house. </s> <s>   When someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family  members assumed it was one of the stolen vehicles often found here. </s> <s>   On Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his brother-in-law  and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from his village near  the West Bank town of Jenin. </s> <s>  Tahayneh had his own score to settle  with the Israelis. </s> <s>  His leg had been amputated after he was shot in  a confrontation with Israeli troops during the uprising, his relatives  said. </s> <s>  The Fiat was loaded with explosives, and the two men drove to  the market. </s> <s>  That evening, when concerned members of the Sughayer family  gathered to await news of their missing relative, a man arrived and  told them that he had sold his car to Youssef the previous day. </s> <s>  It  was a red Fiat, the same car they had seen near the house, and the  same type of car that news reports said had exploded in the marketplace. </s> <s>   At midnight, Israeli security forces raided the house and interrogated  family members. </s> <s>  The last, grim pieces of the puzzle fell into place. </s> <s>   Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking together,  said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with him past midnight  at the produce store. </s> <s>  He asked me about someone who had moved his  hardware shop to another village, about how he was doing. </s> <s>  Earlier  we ate together, and we talked about giving charity to the poor. </s> <s>  He  wasn't nervous. </s> <s>  He had plans for the future, Ali continued. </s> <s>   Maybe the people in his group convinced him to do this, and he could  not refuse. </s> <s>  We did not expect this from him. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Palestinian suicide bomber learned Islamic Jihad doctrine in Israeli prison. </s> </p> </d>
