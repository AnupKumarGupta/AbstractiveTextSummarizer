article= <d> <p> <s>  A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast  faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder  and leader. </s> <s>  Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's  international airport Thursday. </s> <s>  Turkey has asked for his extradition  and Ocalan has asked for political asylum. </s> <s>  Some believe that without  Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his  Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray. </s> <s>  If the  head is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow, said Cengiz  Candar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. </s> <s>   But Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month,  and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him. </s> <s>   Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end  of the PKK. </s> <s>  The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster  for too long, said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily  News. </s> <s>  Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles  within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was beginning  to waver. </s> <s>  Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers  Party, PKK, in 1978. </s> <s>  The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984,  mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also  carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. </s> <s>  Close to  37,000 people died in the conflict. </s> <s>  His presence in Europe could also  be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform  itself from a rebel army into a political movement. </s> <s>  Ocalan seemed  to be moving in this direction before his detention. </s> <s>  While living  in Damacus, he increased his meetings with European deputies. </s> <s>  This  may be the PKK's best option. </s> <s>  The Turkish military claims it has made  important battlefield gains and captured the PKK's second-in-command  this year. </s> <s>  The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria,  which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened  to attack it. </s> <s>  Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border  with Iraq have also grown lukewarm. </s> <s>  The PKK has used their bases in  Syria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations. </s> <s>  The PKK had two  options. </s> <s>  Either they choose to fight until they get control of the  area, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to  take on a political image. </s> <s>  I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the  Middle East so he could become a political figure, said Hikmet Tavak,  managing director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. </s> <s>   In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected  Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause. </s> <s>  They  also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving. </s> <s>   There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if  the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more  pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights. </s> <s>   There are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. </s> <s>  They are not  recognized as an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in  education or broadcasting. </s> <s>  Kurdish politicians have been jailed and  groups banned on charges of supporting the PKK. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> PKK leader Ocalan arrested on arrival at Rome airport; asks for asylum. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
