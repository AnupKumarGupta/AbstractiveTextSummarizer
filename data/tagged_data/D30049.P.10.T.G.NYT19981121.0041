article= <d> <p> <s>  This city has always kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders _ dictators,  unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it  thinks can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's  agenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum. </s> <s>  In the 1950s, the  leftist leaders of Iran and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s  it was populated by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. </s> <s>  President  Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting  in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador  Allende Gossens in Chile was to make the economy scream. </s> <s>  Diplomatic  etiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies  list from the White House rooftop. </s> <s>  After all, foreign policy isn't  about personalities, right? </s> <s>  But last week, driven by frustration,  or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the  Clinton administration piped up, twice. </s> <s>  In very different situations,  in opposite corners of the world, the United States spoke loudly because  it can't find a stick. </s> <s>  Sunday, hours after he called off an attack  on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of  U.S. </s> <s>  policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein  _ what Clinton called supporting the forces of change in Iraq. </s> <s>   No matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably. </s> <s>   The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used  his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw  U.S. </s> <s>  support behind protesters calling for reformasi, the code  word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed. </s> <s>  He has long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing  America, its currency traders and its Jews. </s> <s>  He recently imprisoned  his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who has suddenly  become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. </s> <s>  But Mahathir is no Saddam,  not by a long shot. </s> <s>  Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call  for reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. </s> <s>  But it wasn't interpreted  that way. </s> <s>  The New Zealanders called it megaphone diplomacy. </s> <s>  The  Malaysian government called it disgusting and an interference  in internal affairs. </s> <s>  Predictably, executives of several U.S. </s> <s>  companies  that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians that Gore was  rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered words that needed  to be said. </s> <s>  Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the  question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful  nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome  leader to go. </s> <s>  Because there is no official list, there are no real  criteria for getting on it. </s> <s>  Some leaders mysteriously escape mention,  like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. </s> <s>  President Clinton is spending the  weekend on the Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized  zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to  break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects,  in return for billions in Western energy aid. </s> <s>  Yet Washington has never  called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive  regime. </s> <s>  His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook,  suggested last week that if the United States really wants to look  at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a nuclear installation  in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. </s> <s>  No  one even called for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lobbed  a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how. </s> <s>  The rules  for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky, said Richard  Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego  who served in the Clinton administration's first term. </s> <s>  When they  really want to push someone out, it is because that country is part  of a larger strategic concern at the time. </s> <s>  But the country itself  usually doesn't have great strategic weight _ it's another matter  to call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow _ and it  helps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point  to. </s> <s>  Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely  a ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler  of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who was President  George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam  nowadays is simply an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem,  but not a threat to the region at the moment). </s> <s>  Mahathir, however,  is far more complex case. </s> <s>  He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's  political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move  a leader from the list of authoritarians whom Washington tolerates  to the list of authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness. </s> <s>   Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and  Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was  that Malaysia would become a communist domino. </s> <s>  But he also seemed  eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. </s> <s>  He has never  been accused of enormous corruption. </s> <s>  He turned his country into a  model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar of the  big emerging markets that Clinton's Commerce Department touted  until things went sour last year. </s> <s>  Sure, he was always prickly. </s> <s>  But  he is no terrorist or killer _ U.S. </s> <s>  companies have flocked to his  country, and say they want to stay _ and his iron control over political  discourse is no stronger than in neighboring Singapore. </s> <s>  Just this  summer, U.S. </s> <s>  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly  friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference to human rights. </s> <s>   That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail. </s> <s>  He  has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to economic  turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest movement against  Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. </s> <s>  Gore leapt on that opportunity  _ particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier  this year, it took the administration months to come to the conclusion  that President Suharto had to go. </s> <s>  He went. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Leaders of Iraq and Malaysia on US "hit list": why not North Korea's Kim? </s> <s> .
