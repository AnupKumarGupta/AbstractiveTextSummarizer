article= <d> <p> <s>  Times are tough in the oil patch. </s> <s>  Still, it boggles the mind to accept  the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge,  as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least  to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing. </s> <s>  Oil companies  of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the  high capital costs of exploration. </s> <s>  Given the exotic locales of the  most promising untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration  will get cheaper. </s> <s>  And with West Texas crude trading at around $12  a barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil won't be selling for $100 a  barrel by the turn of the century _ something analysts were predicting  during the oil price run-up of the early 1980s. </s> <s>  Philip Verleger Jr.,  publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the  Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass. </s> <s> , consulting firm, spent some time  late last week talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics  of the oil business. </s> <s>  Following are excerpts from the conversation:  Q. There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon-Mobil  deal. </s> <s>  Do you see any problems? </s> <s>  A. Let me say right off that I don't  think this is a done deal. </s> <s>  I think it is far from that. </s> <s>  But if it  were to happen, I don't see many problems. </s> <s>  BP Amoco is the perfect  end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with  the company you are merging with. </s> <s>  Exxon-Mobil comes close. </s> <s>  The first  issue is competition in local markets. </s> <s>  The only possible problem area  there is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players  there. </s> <s>  If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention,  it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly  toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's  positions on global warming. </s> <s>  Q. Why are you skeptical about the deal? </s> <s>   A. Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger. </s> <s>  They had talks with  Amoco. </s> <s>  They wanted to buy Conoco. </s> <s>  But I don't understand where Lucio  Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this. </s> <s>  That could be an impediment  to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place,  and he has been a very strong leader. </s> <s>  Q. Mobil is the country's second-biggest  oil company, behind Exxon. </s> <s>  Why do they need to get bigger? </s> <s>  A. In the  first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities  will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest  pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP  Amoco. </s> <s>  Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal players. </s> <s>  Q.  That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn  in prices. </s> <s>  A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production  expenditures rose 8 percent. </s> <s>  Mobil's rose 14 percent. </s> <s>  But Mobil's  expenditures were much more sensitive to the price elasticities of  oil than Exxon's. </s> <s>  They were pushing the envelope, and when prices  fell they had to cut back. </s> <s>  Exxon has tried to build a very large presence  systematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or  even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices. </s> <s>  They are brutally efficient. </s> <s>   Q. Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices would  stay soft for nearly a decade. </s> <s>  Do you agree? </s> <s>  A. You know, every time  I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock  in oil companies. </s> <s>  I think we are going to see low oil prices for six  months to a year. </s> <s>  It is conceivable we could go into the next century  with oil at $5 a barrel, depending on what happens to the world economy. </s> <s>   During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in  investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in  supply coming out of non-OPEC countries. </s> <s>  That will strengthen the  hands of the OPEC countries. </s> <s>  And when the Asian economies start growing  again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say $20 a  barrel, in the next 18 months. </s> <s>  Q. The number of oil companies is going  to shrink in coming years, regardless, isn't it? </s> <s>  A. We are probably  heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six  big oil companies, possibly eight. </s> <s>  There is really no precedent for  having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this  modern society. </s> <s>  Q. Do you think oil stocks are a good investment? </s> <s>   A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it  is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over  the next 9 to 12 months. </s> <s>  And it is an area where investors need to  be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation  among smaller companies. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Low petroleum prices causing oil companies to consider merger talks. </s> </p> </d>
