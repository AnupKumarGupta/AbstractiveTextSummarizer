article= <d> <p> <s>  Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of  the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story  tower in the shuttle cargo bay. </s> <s>  It was the first time that the Russian-built  Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever  touched. </s> <s>  It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. </s> <s>   We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced the  two pieces came together. </s> <s>  Congratulations to the crew of the good  ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. </s> <s>  That's terrific. </s> <s>  The  240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy  Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle  robot arm. </s> <s>  We're halfway home, Cabana said. </s> <s>  Then came the hard  part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. </s> <s>  The two station  pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the  other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her  crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views,  rather than direct line of sight. </s> <s>  This was the first time such a blind  docking had ever been attempted. </s> <s>  Currie positioned the solar-winged  Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly  above Unity. </s> <s>  It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. </s> <s>   Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters,  and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for  the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. </s> <s>   The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. </s> <s>  The union  _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime _ set the  stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical  connectors and cables between the two components. </s> <s>  Mission Control  thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave  the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. </s> <s>  But everything occurred  more or less when and how it was supposed to, aside from a piece of  space junk that strayed too close. </s> <s>  Before beginning their final approach  to Zarya, the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket  launched last month from California. </s> <s>  Mission Control ordered the pilots  to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between  Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles  from the orbiting debris. </s> <s>  The smaller gap would have been probably  a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. </s> <s>  The bigger  worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya,  and its coupling with Unity. </s> <s>  The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never  before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya,  a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on  Nov. </s> <s>  20. </s> <s>  It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering  for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can  be launched next summer. </s> <s>  Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called  down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian  flight controllers had feared. </s> <s>  The antennas must be fully deployed  in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't  be needed before next summer, officials said. </s> <s>  The only other problem  was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. </s> <s>   The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component,  will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. </s> <s>   It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be  connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking  astronauts to manually fit them together. </s> <s>  In all, three spacewalks  are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical  connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other  tools for future crews. </s> <s>  The joined modules will be released from Endeavour  once all of the work is completed. </s> <s>  NASA estimates 43 more launches  and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble  the entire orbiting complex. </s> <s>  Once completed, the 16-nation space station  will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field,  and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Endeavour astronauts connect Russian and U.S. </s> <s>  components of space station. </s> </p> </d>
