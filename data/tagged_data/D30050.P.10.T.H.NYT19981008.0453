article= <d> <p> <s>  The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election  as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his  most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory  margins in Ohio politics. </s> <s>  This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is  barred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for  the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. </s> <s>  And  while there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark  of four years ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge  that he is well positioned to increase the Republican majority in  the Senate. </s> <s>  That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent,  Mary Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. </s> <s>  Ms. Boyle, a former  commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing  the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as  a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring,  has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats _  President Clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail. </s> <s>  Glenn,  the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month  at the age of 77, has not made an endorsement in the Senate race. </s> <s>   Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard  on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, as a  lackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline. </s> <s>  He  promised to be the education governor, said Ms. Boyle. </s> <s>  But after  seven and a half years he has failed the students of this state. </s> <s>   Her role in the campaign, she said, is to remind the people of the  state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a promise and that he didn't  deliver on it. </s> <s>  Specifically, she discusses a decision last year  by the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality  of the state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for  funding them. </s> <s>  She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting  a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. </s> <s>  Under that  plan, half the additional funds would have been used for school improvement  with the remainder earmarked for reducing property taxes. </s> <s>  That statewide  ballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about  80 percent of the voters opposing it. </s> <s>  While the topics of taxes and  education are hot ones this political season in Ohio, it is not clear  that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them has helped her campaign. </s> <s>  Despite  some narrowing in the opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich  by 15 percentage points in some polls and as much as 20 points in  others. </s> <s>  There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. </s> <s>  Ms. Boyle, who  is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support,  has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million  Voinovich has taken in. </s> <s>  Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor,  has been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and  thus is the better-known candidate. </s> <s>  The electoral dynamics of Ohio  are also aiding Voinovich. </s> <s>  The northern half of the state, with its  history of industrial, unionized cities, has a tradition of voting  largely for Democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the  state is considered more conservative and typically leans Republican. </s> <s>   But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving  Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic  candidates. </s> <s>  Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers  to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. </s> <s>   And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, has developed a reputation  as a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats. </s> <s>  Voinovich,  while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of  official duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. </s> <s>   If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic  policy than any member of the Senate, he said in an interview on  Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony  and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. </s> <s>  As mayor,  I had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban America and was fairly  successful in dealing with them. </s> <s>  And, as governor, I have dealt with  the problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. </s> <s>  I'm the only person  in the United States who has been president of the National League  of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association. </s> <s>  To  his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. </s> <s>   I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has been  endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education  Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a member of the  state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. </s> <s>   Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and  a member of the Democratic leadership during those years, Voinovich  said. </s> <s>  They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did nothing for  technology and the urban school districts. </s> <s>  Ms. Boyle, who has not  yet begun to run campaign commercials on television, said her status  as the underdog had allowed me to be more focused, more intense. </s> <s>   Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic  Sen. </s> <s>  Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said:  This has been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. </s> <s>  But now,  we're down to the last three miles. </s> <s>  It's a tough race. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Boyle in Tough Senate Race Against Popular Republican Gov. </s> <s>  Voinovich. </s> </p> </d>
