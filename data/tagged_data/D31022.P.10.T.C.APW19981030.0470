article= <d> <p> <s>  A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers  into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180  in Sweden's second-largest city. </s> <s>  The fast-spreading fire completely  gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that  local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a gas chamber. </s> <s>   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the  dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for  a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective leading  the disaster investigation. </s> <s>  The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian  Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish  history. </s> <s>  In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town  of Boraas. </s> <s>  At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims  choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found  at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said. </s> <s>   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children  of immigrant. </s> <s>  Police said the list of injured included Somalis and  people from current and former Yugoslavia. </s> <s>  The Macedonian Association,  which rents space in the building, had in turn rented the facility  out to another person for the dance, Carlsson said. </s> <s>  That person was  not immdiately identified. </s> <s>  Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian  Association when he saw the fire. </s> <s>  He said he raced in and pulled to  safety several people, including a friend. </s> <s>  His clothes had burned  off. </s> <s>  His skin was red and bubbly, Atta said. </s> <s>  Lots of kids were  just screaming, he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where  several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. </s> <s>  I saw about  10 people in windows who just jumped. </s> <s>  They didn't even look down  beforehand. </s> <s>  Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. </s> <s>  (2243 GMT) Thursday  and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers  said. </s> <s>  The blaze was already consuming the building. </s> <s>  The building had  just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician  Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT. </s> <s>   It was a panic, Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with  youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling  with police to get in and attempt to help friends. </s> <s>  The cause of the  fire was not immediately known, although officials said it apparently  began with an explosion. </s> <s>  Olin said there were indications that the  fire could have been set. </s> <s>  The fact that it spread so fast indicates  that it was not a normal fire, he said. </s> <s>  About 180 people were taken  to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in intensive care. </s> <s>  Seven  of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to burn clinics  in other cities. </s> <s>  Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest  of the capital, Stockholm. </s> <s>  The crowd in the second story of the building  contained mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday  weekend. </s> <s>  A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave  from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally  and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,  the Goteborg city council said in a statement. </s> <s>  Goteborg is today  a city in shock. </s> <s>  Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire  site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. </s> <s>   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the  blaze started with about 400 people inside. </s> <s>  It looked like it started  in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor, he  was quoted as saying. </s> <s>  It was chaos. </s> <s>  Everybody was trying to get  out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. </s> <s>  . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>   Others kicked out the windows and jumped out. </s> <s>  Ambulances were called  in from several nearby communities. </s> <s>  The Goteborg rescue services also  brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. </s> <s>  Anna-Lisa  Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims  were taken, said identifying many of them was difficult. </s> <s>  Maybe you  have teen-agers yourself and know how they are . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  They maybe don't  have their own identification, but have that of a friend who is a  year older. </s> <s>  Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in  a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body, she said, according  to TT. </s> <s>  Goteborg has about 435,000 people. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> At least 60 killed at dancehall fire in Sweden's second largest city. </s> </p> </d>
