article= <d> <p> <s>  By sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners  to long prison terms, China on Monday took its harshest steps yet  in its current crackdown on organized political opposition. </s> <s>  After  a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55  the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent  12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13  years for subversion of state power. </s> <s>  Xu's alleged crimes included  helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist  rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent  labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident  abroad. </s> <s>  He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court  just four days ago and met his client only once. </s> <s>  Also sentenced Monday,  to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy  Party, which has now been suppressed. </s> <s>  Wang was tried on subversion  charges on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer,  in the eastern city of Hangzhou. </s> <s>  The punishment of a third veteran  democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. </s> <s>  His  trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene  on Tuesday, relatives said. </s> <s>  A similarly long sentence is expected. </s> <s>   Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's  visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to  move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the  State Department. </s> <s>  They also appeared to spell the effective end here  of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds  of lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months. </s> <s>  The  long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals  here that China's warming relations with the United States in recent  years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring  a significant easing of political controls. </s> <s>  Xu was tried Monday morning  in the Beijing Intermediate Court. </s> <s>  When after a brief recess the three-judge  panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, I  protest! </s> <s>  said his wife of 28 years, He Xintong. </s> <s>  Then, said Ms. He  and lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair  and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were  illegitimate. </s> <s>  With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government  has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one  who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. </s> <s>  Xu first  came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late  1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. </s> <s>   In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out  and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried  to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants  it has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil  and political rights. </s> <s>  In the face of several temporary detentions  and stiff warnings, they continued their activities. </s> <s>  Wang, in contrast,  first became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate  student in physics in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen  Square demonstrations. </s> <s>  After the student movement was smashed by the  army, he was on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent  two years in prison. </s> <s>  During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang  announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. </s> <s>  Hundreds around  the country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea. </s> <s>  But while  the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political  topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has  not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized  groups _ to the principle of Communist Party rule. </s> <s>  In a speech on  Friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the president and  Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the  party, saying, The Western mode of political systems must never  be adopted. </s> <s>  After learning of Monday's sentences, the American Embassy  here, which has spent the last two years building improved relations  between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation  of what it termed the deplorable decisions. </s> <s>  We are deeply disappointed  with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,  the statement said. </s> <s>  No individual should be arrested, tried and  sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including  those guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political  Rights, to which China has committed itself. </s> <s>  Like Thursday's trials,  both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective  lawyers had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding  showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts  could write their own rules. </s> <s>  According to the criminal procedure law,  defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but  Xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. </s> <s>  His  wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his  arrest on Nov. </s> <s>  30, was told three days ago. </s> <s>  Under the law, defendants  also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu was assigned  a lawyer by the court late last week. </s> <s>  Before Monday morning's trial,  the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting,  an associate of Mo's said. </s> <s>  Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before  the trial. </s> <s>  Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the  whole charade, she said in a telephone interview this weekend. </s> <s>  Responding  to the accusations during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued  that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and  that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state,  an associate of the lawyer said. </s> <s>  But in a decision that was clearly  preordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend  what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. </s> <s>  Born in 1943 in  the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu was interested in politics  even as a teen-ager, his wife said. </s> <s>  In the 1960s, as an idealistic  Marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend  a university. </s> <s>  He served in the navy for five years, then became an  electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with  the democracy movement and going to prison. </s> <s>  On Monday afternoon, in  a police station hours after the trial finished, Xu was allowed a  half-hour with his wife. </s> <s>  He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,  she later recounted in a telephone interview. </s> <s>  He said that this  would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what  has happened. </s> <s>  Ms. He, who has been married to Xu since 1971, said  she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison. </s> <s>  The couple has  a daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at Boston  University. </s> <s>  In an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested  on Nov. </s> <s>  30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, I can't change the way  I am. </s> <s>  If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should  go on and enjoy her life. </s> <s>  And if I die, Xu said as they parted  that day, please plant a tree for me. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> China: two
