article= <d> <p> <s>  One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on  Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants  as possible, administration officials now acknowledge. </s> <s>  According to  the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the  months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal  under U.S. </s> <s>  and international law. </s> <s>  The officials said the raid was  timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps  at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would  be meeting there with his chief operatives. </s> <s>  A 1976 executive order  bars anyone working for the U.S. </s> <s>  government from plotting or carrying  out assassinations. </s> <s>  But officials said the White House legal opinion  drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority  to target the infrastructure of terrorist groups that are attacking  Americans. </s> <s>  A top U.S. </s> <s>  counterterrorism official said this week that  the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly human. </s> <s>  As  we said from the time of the Aug. </s> <s>  20 strike, the objective was to  disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden  terrorist network at the Khost camps, said David C. Leavy, a spokesman  for the National Security Council at the White House. </s> <s>  Targeting infrastructure,  officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of  a terrorist group. </s> <s>  Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable  target, Leavy said. </s> <s>  Senior administration officials said they never  discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions. </s> <s>  His death,  they said in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a  side benefit. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence officials say they now believe that  bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears  to have left unscathed before the missiles hit. </s> <s>  Officials said there  were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have  died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were  between 50 and 100. </s> <s>  Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction  between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking  a group of people who command a terrorist organization. </s> <s>  Administration  officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill  bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors  with leading a global war against U.S. </s> <s>  interests. </s> <s>  He has been linked  to the Aug. </s> <s>  7 bombing of two U.S. </s> <s>  embassies in East Africa. </s> <s>  But a  less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. </s> <s>  13 by Defense Secretary  William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United  States had been going after bin Laden and his colleagues. </s> <s>  We  weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, but we sent a message. </s> <s>   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not  retracted his statements. </s> <s>  The Los Angeles Times recently reported  that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use  deadly force against terrorist leaders. </s> <s>  Bin Laden's organization was  a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the  bombing of the U.S. </s> <s>  embassies in East Africa. </s> <s>  Last spring, officials  said, U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan  to capture the Saudi exile. </s> <s>  Officials said that at roughly the same  time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military  attacks against a terrorist leadership. </s> <s>  That review, officials said,  provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the  meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would  be gathered. </s> <s>  The review, by the National Security Council, was the  basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order  banning assassinations. </s> <s>  That ban was imposed by President Ford in  1975, after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the  CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and  others. </s> <s>  The order said: No person employed by, or acting on behalf  of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage  in, assassination. </s> <s>  While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified  ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over  the years. </s> <s>  In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist  attack against U.S. </s> <s>  soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. </s> <s>   The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. </s> <s>   And in the Gulf War, U.S. </s> <s>  forces used powerful bombs in an attempt  to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. </s> <s>  The legal review conducted  by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future  operations in similar circumstances. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Objective of August raid on Afghanistan was to kill bin Laden and his men. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
