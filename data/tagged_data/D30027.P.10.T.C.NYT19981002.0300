article= <d> <p> <s>  The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within  the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia  about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. </s> <s>  In her first comprehensive  review of U.S. </s> <s> -Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime  minister last month, Albright said Washington was deeply concerned  about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would  soon abate. </s> <s>  We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing  new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and  restoring state management of parts of the economy, she told the  U.S. </s> <s> -Russia Business Council in Chicago. </s> <s>  We can only wonder if some  members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the  global economy. </s> <s>  While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when  he was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key  issues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him. </s> <s>  Our  initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been  particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now is whether  that cooperation can continue. </s> <s>  The United States must keep up its  aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy  and student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. </s> <s>  Washington  does not favor more direct aid. </s> <s>  More big bailouts are not by themselves  going to restore investor confidence in Russia, she said. </s> <s>  In the  long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be  met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment. </s> <s>  Albright  sharply criticized as self-defeating the many voices in Russia who  want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and  our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition  and defiance for its own stake. </s> <s>  Russia could not stand alone in  the world, she said, and the United States' ability to help Russians  help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to  being absolutely impossible. </s> <s>  At the same time, she said, Washington  would not assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people  in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock. </s> <s>  And she  urged the world _ and American critics _ to be patient with the  workings of the democratic process in Russia and not start each  day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin, a census that  American officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin  dismissed the previous government. </s> <s>  While Moscow may continue to oppose  any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province  of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Economic confusion in Russia causes disappointment in Washington. </s> </p> </d>
