article= <d> <p> <s>  President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely  trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran  politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political  leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. </s> <s>  Bulent Ecevit of  the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a  government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. </s> <s>  It  is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win  a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks  with Demirel. </s> <s>  We have told the president that we will not hamper  the appointment of a deputy of Parliament. </s> <s>  With party leaders unable  to overcome differences, the new premier-designate would most probably  be affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other parties to  follow an independent line. </s> <s>  Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been  suggested as a likely candidate. </s> <s>  The new appointment would be made  within days, Yilmaz told reporters. </s> <s>  Demirel consulted Turkey's party  leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up. </s> <s>  Most declared themselves  in favor of a government led by a lawmaker. </s> <s>  Only center-right leader  Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and  made clear she was willing to take on the task. </s> <s>  Turkey's parliament  is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right  parties. </s> <s>  Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November  amid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with  the sale of a state bank. </s> <s>  By tradition, Demirel should then have asked  the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government. </s> <s>   But Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue  Party from power. </s> <s>  Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the  return of an Islamic-led government. </s> <s>  Modern Turkey has had only one  Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military  pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular  traditions. </s> <s>  Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the  Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Speaker of Turkish parliament likely to form government; Islamic party out. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
