article= <d> <p> <s>  The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute  with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99  season. </s> <s>  It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that  it will lose regular-season games. </s> <s>  The NBA's deputy commissioner,  Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half  hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel. </s> <s>  The decision to  cancel 99 games between Nov. </s> <s>  3 and Nov. </s> <s>  16 came after the players  association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of  a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to  by Friday. </s> <s>  We tried our best today to try to do what was possible  to salvage the season, said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. </s> <s>   Unfortunately, it didn't work out. </s> <s>  After 35,001 games without  a blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey League, the National  Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost games to  a labor dispute. </s> <s>  Taking into account that a three- to four-week period  would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the  season starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether  to make further cancellations. </s> <s>  I'm very sad and disappointed,  said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. </s> <s>  I consider it to be a collective  failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. </s> <s>  I  do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game. </s> <s>   And I believe this is. </s> <s>  The decision came after what both sides agreed  were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout  on the player July 1. </s> <s>  Seventeen players, including union president  Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe  Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik  and five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden  president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon  Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of  Phoenix. </s> <s>  The talks featured what the players association implied were  a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate  the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the  owners. </s> <s>  The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2  billion in league-wide income. </s> <s>  The main sticking point has been the  owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation  of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue  growth. </s> <s>  While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry  Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount  of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address  the exception in their taxation proposal. </s> <s>  The main points were as  follows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above  $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised  their Bird rights. </s> <s>  For example, if a player made $20 million, the  team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most  likely be distributed to low-revenue teams. </s> <s>  There could be provisions  made for some players, said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel  for the union. </s> <s>  We don't want to do anything that would encourage  Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back. </s> <s>  And I think the league feels  the same way. </s> <s>  The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed  by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly  as liberal. </s> <s>  _ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league  pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. </s> <s>  Whatever figure  over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. </s> <s>  If the figure  was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work  with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season. </s> <s>  But the  players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at  least $2 million before the credit goes into effect. </s> <s>  _ Also, if the  63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises  would take effect for multi-year contracts. </s> <s>  Players would either get  raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. </s> <s>  The  union said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries  in line with revenues. </s> <s>  Since the owners re-opened the current agreement  because 57. </s> <s> 1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent  figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners  to agree to such a proposal. </s> <s>  _ Teams would get a right of first refusal  on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning  a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the  first four years of his deal. </s> <s>  Currently, the rookie scale is three  years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his  Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into  an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. </s> <s>  _ Finally,  the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. </s> <s>  Details of  testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took  place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision  the owners included in their last proposal. </s> <s>  In return for the concessions,  the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500  _ and creation of an average salary exception. </s> <s>  This would allow every  team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year  for the average salary _ currently $2. </s> <s> 6 million. </s> <s>  We're buoyed by  the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,  the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. </s> <s>  I don't know  if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers  in the eye and say we made a valiant effort. </s> <s>  Asked if the players  would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games,  Hunter added: It's not about us blinking. </s> <s>  We want to reach an agreement. </s> <s>   We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. </s> <s>  Our  position all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal. </s> <s>   Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month  and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason  games. </s> <s>  He estimated the losses into the hundreds of millions of  dollars. </s> <s>  I think we have serious concern whether a tax system  can address the kind of needs we have economically, he added. </s> <s>  But  there's some possibility. </s> <s>  Added Stern, We owe it to the fans to  go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve  the result we wanted. </s> <s>  It doesn't look promising, but we're going to  spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response. </s> <s>   Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent  a major shift in prior labor stalemates. </s> <s>  Both sides reluctantly hammered  out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole  notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record. </s> <s>   Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. </s> <s>  I'd like to think  these our the last games we have to cancel, Granik said. </s> <s>  But unless  this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough,  I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Though Players Offer Plan, For First Time in History NBA Games
