article= <d> <p> <s>  Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left  government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday  to try to reach a consensus on a new government. </s> <s>  Following the talks,  which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. </s> <s>  He could also name  a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. </s> <s>  If Scalfaro  feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call  early elections. </s> <s>  Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament  during the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be  scheduled by December. </s> <s>  Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier  for the interim. </s> <s>  Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked  the crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999  deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate  job creation. </s> <s>  Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists,  who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence  by a single vote. </s> <s>  Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless  his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an  unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. </s> <s>  An alternative to  Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left,  the largest party in Prodi's coalition. </s> <s>  In the case of a so-called  technical government, the names of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. </s> <s>  A  government of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period  of approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European  currency, the euro, in January 1999. </s> <s>  Prodi presided over cost cuts  that got Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlasting  all but one other post-World War II Italian government in the process. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Consensus on new gov't sought. </s> <s>  Budget rejected for job stimulation lack. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
