article= <d> <p> <s>  North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages  with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable  illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. </s> <s>  The officials  warned against international complacency and hostility toward North  Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country  shows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its  ruined economy. </s> <s>  Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any  part of the world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary  of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting  the aid agency's operations in North Korea. </s> <s>  She and other Red Cross  officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine:  electricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time;  the elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation  of children stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and  5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. </s> <s>  Everywhere, from bakeries to government  ministries, people were being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans  mixed with acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg  said. </s> <s>  Heiberg likened the additives to cattle food and noted that  doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures. </s> <s>  This  is really part of the daily life, she said. </s> <s>  You would not give  them to your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get  cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning. </s> <s>   Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated  North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering  from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners. </s> <s>  With few goods  or money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the country lacks sufficient  fertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts for machinery. </s> <s>  The Red Cross  inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's  main vegetable. </s> <s>  The grain harvest is finished and by U.N. </s> <s>  estimates  little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough  to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people. </s> <s>   As the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics  show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened  patients unable to recover from operations and sickness, Heiberg said. </s> <s>   Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter  may take a toll on the weakened population, she said. </s> <s>  One 10-bed  hospital in the countryside was keeping only three patients at a time  because it did not have food to care for more, said Heiberg. </s> <s>  The Red  Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential  medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea. </s> <s>  Food aid is  largely being turned over to U.N. </s> <s>  agencies. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Red Cross reports severe famine and starvation in North Korea. </s> </p> </d>
