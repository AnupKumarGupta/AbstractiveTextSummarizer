article= <d> <p> <s>  China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from  a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the  United States. </s> <s>  Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by  the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming  trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. </s> <s>  Xu is the third leading member  of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion  in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested  or interrogated. </s> <s>  Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China  Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending  the trial, Xu's wife said. </s> <s>  Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was  free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing  as manipulative. </s> <s>  We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese  government for this cynical game it is playing, said Xiao Qiang,  director of New York-based Human Rights in China. </s> <s>  After 3 1/2 years  in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts  of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian  Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother  said. </s> <s>  Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their  11-year-old daughter, the family said. </s> <s>  Liu Nianchun's release follows  the same pattern China used in freeing its two most famous dissidents,  Wei Jingsheng in Nov. </s> <s>  1997 and Wang Dan in April. </s> <s>  Authorities released  Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison  term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy  campaigner, Liu Qing. </s> <s>  Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for  at least two years. </s> <s>  In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide  last month, doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach  and bowels, Liu Qing said. </s> <s>  Like Wang and Wei, the United States and  other Western governments have lobbied China to release Liu. </s> <s>  Chinese  leaders have been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout  the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among  dissidents at home. </s> <s>  In the only official comment on the release, the  Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account  Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole  for medical treatment. </s> <s>  I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at  the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a  type of human rights violation and persecution, Liu Qing said in  a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. </s> <s>   Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the fractured,  persecuted dissident community. </s> <s>  His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons  and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's Communist  Party rulers punish people they deem a threat. </s> <s>  Liu was imprisoned  three times in the past 17 years. </s> <s>  His last arrest came after he signed  a petition calling for labor rights in May 1995. </s> <s>  Liu was never put  on trial. </s> <s>  Fourteen months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first  learned of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor  camp in the frigid, remote northeast. </s> <s>  His term was the maximum police  may impose on criminal suspects without trial. </s> <s>  Labor camp officials  later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge  Chu claimed was fabricated. </s> <s>  Inside the labor camp, Liu once started  a hunger strike to protest his treatment. </s> <s>  He was beaten with cattle  prods and confined to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where  he could only sit or stand. </s> <s>  His wife endured police harassment, beatings  and detentions in campaigning for his release. </s> <s>  Chu was dragged away  and hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. </s> <s>   human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> China exiles labor dissenter; trial to begin against political dissenter. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
