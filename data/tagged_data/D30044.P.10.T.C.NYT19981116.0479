article= <d> <p> <s>  Facing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo  D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader  who was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. </s> <s>  Turkey wants Italy  to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers'  Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. </s> <s>  He  is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist. </s> <s>  Germany also has a warrant out  for his arrest on homicide charges. </s> <s>  But D'Alema, a former Communist  who was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from  leftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. </s> <s>  In a news  conference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. </s> <s>  The  last thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like  this one, he said. </s> <s>  He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition  of suspects to countries that have the death penalty. </s> <s>  Turkey has capital  punishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. </s> <s>  Ocalan is being  tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. </s> <s>   D'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine  whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be  possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday,  holds up. </s> <s>  We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,  D'Alema said. </s> <s>  This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody  conflict. </s> <s>  Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government  met with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial  meeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration  and hunger strike in support of Ocalan. </s> <s>  D'Alema's decision was further  complicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul  took an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only  after Italy extradited Ocalan. </s> <s>  Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow  to pressure. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Italian Prime Minister pressured by leftists to offer Ocalan asylum. </s> </p> </d>
