article= <d> <p> <s>  When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize  in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters. </s> <s>   Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world  ever since. </s> <s>  A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday,  when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's  most prestigious prize for writers. </s> <s>  The prize focuses intense media  attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally  drowns out a question: Why does the world care so much about the literary  choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? </s> <s>  Does  the Nobel Prize really recognize the best? </s> <s>  When asked that question,  Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said Look  at the list of prizewinners! </s> <s>  The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. </s> <s>   On one hand, the Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers  such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to  light, such as Wislawa Szymborska. </s> <s>  But the prize arguably also has  honored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been  more fairly served by obscurity. </s> <s>  Among them is the winner of the first  prize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme. </s> <s>  That choice was denounced by Sweden's  leading literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent  a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not  choosing him. </s> <s>  Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable,  considering the instructions they were given. </s> <s>  Nobel's will says the  prize should recognize literature that works in an ideal direction. </s> <s>   What, exactly, he meant by ideal** is unclear and the Academy's  choices have reflected the confusion. </s> <s>  The Academy has chosen to interpret  the word to apply to works ranging from the good-hearted charm of  Szymborska's poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's  writings. </s> <s>  When Nobel wrote the word ideal _ in Swedish idealisk**  _ he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one. </s> <s>  Allen  was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a forensic  expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were. </s> <s>  The expert  succeeded _ to a point. </s> <s>  He found that the first word Nobel wrote was  idealirad, a word that doesn't exist. </s> <s>  Despite the inclarity around  the edges, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choices bolster  Nobel's core idea that literature would be the basis for some kind  of progress. </s> <s>  About this year's choice, he won't say more than that:  the Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret. </s> <s>  But observers  love to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for  the prize, this year worth 7. </s> <s> 6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). </s> <s>   Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S. </s> <s>  Naipaul,  China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago  of Portugal. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Nobel Literature Laureates- the great and not-so-great: five picks. </s> </p> </d>
