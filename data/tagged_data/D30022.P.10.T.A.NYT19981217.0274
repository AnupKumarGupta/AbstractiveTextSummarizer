article= <d> <p> <s>  The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting  subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families  of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers. </s> <s>   The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder  of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session  for just two hours and 10 minutes. </s> <s>  It appears to be finished, although  the court did not announce a decision or say when it would. </s> <s>  I don't  know what happens from here, said Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who  was one of three relatives allowed to attend the trial. </s> <s>  I don't  hold much hope, she added in a telephone interview. </s> <s>  Wang, who spent  two years in prison after the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen  Square, was accused of organizing a political party that sought to  overturn Communist Party rule and of colluding with foreign enemies  of the state. </s> <s>  He could face five years or more in prison. </s> <s>  Since all  the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by security agents,  Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning  after prosecutors laid out their case. </s> <s>  But the judge frequently interrupted  him and cut him off after half an hour, saying he was not responding  to the specific facts of the case, she added. </s> <s>  Wang argued that his  activities were legal under China's constitution and under an international  covenant on political rights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said. </s> <s>  In  the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin,  45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something over two hours. </s> <s>   It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since  the session ended after the prosecution presented its charges. </s> <s>  In  that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained,  family members said. </s> <s>  The elderly father's request to the court Thursday  morning for a postponement was ignored, so he and one of the defendant's  brothers stayed outside the court building in protest, leaving another  brother inside. </s> <s>  We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the  trial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then  as far as we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless, the  father said by telephone. </s> <s>  The U.S. </s> <s>  Embassy asked to observe the trials. </s> <s>   When an embassy official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday  morning, he was told that there were no seats available and instead  waited outside, greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the  brief trial. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Chinese democracy advocates, denied lawyers, mount own defenses. </s> </p> </d>
