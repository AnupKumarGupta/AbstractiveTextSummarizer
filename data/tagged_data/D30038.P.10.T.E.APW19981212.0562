article= <d> <p> <s>  A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread  Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver  votes in the selection of host cities. </s> <s>  Marc Hodler, a senior member  of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices  in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. </s> <s>  Hodler  said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved  in promising votes for payment. </s> <s>  He declined to identify them. </s> <s>  The  four agents try to make a living out of this, he said. </s> <s>  I missed  a chance to be a rich man. </s> <s>  Some of the agents do the following: they  say, `I can offer this or that number of votes. </s> <s> ' The price would  be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of votes,  a bloc. </s> <s>  Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning  the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. </s> <s>  Hodler,  an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who boasts that  no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his help. </s> <s>  No one  can prove that, Hodler said. </s> <s>  It could be possible. </s> <s>  He said he  believed agents had been buying and selling votes for the past 10  years. </s> <s>  There are four agents we know, he said. </s> <s>  One is an IOC  member. </s> <s>  He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding city)  can win. </s> <s>  Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said,  I know of so many times. </s> <s>  There is a good chance it is always the  case. </s> <s>  IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated  himself from Hodler's allegations. </s> <s>  The only official spokeman for  the IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard,  Samaranch said. </s> <s>  All the other comments are personal comments. </s> <s>  They  are not official comments. </s> <s>  Hodler's allegations, made to a group  of reporters, came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged  financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid  for the 2002 games. </s> <s>  Hodler has described as a bribe the dlrs 500,000  scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives  of six IOC members. </s> <s>  It also came as the former minister in charge  of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes  in exchange for votes. </s> <s>  Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister,  said he refused. </s> <s>  Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the  1996 games was clean, Hodler said, Certainly not. </s> <s>  John Krimsky,  deputy secretary general of the U.S. </s> <s>  Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's  assertion. </s> <s>  There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at  this point, Krimsky said. </s> <s>  All these issues should be put to the  IOC review commission. </s> <s>  Hodler also leveled allegations against the  head of the Athens bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. </s> <s>  Hodler  said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek businessman who led  the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members as stupid for imposing  restrictions on the bidding process. </s> <s>  For me there is only one purpose:  winning the games, Hodler quoted Metaxa as saying. </s> <s>  I will do whatever  is necessary to win the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs  10 million or dlrs 100 million. </s> <s>  Hodler said he didn't know of any  misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004 games. </s> <s>  Asked whether  Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean, Hodler said, I would  be surprised. </s> <s>  I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it. </s> <s>   I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others, he said. </s> <s>   Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean. </s> <s>  The committee  which won the 1998 games for Nagano certainly had to do things which  are not legitimate, Hodler said. </s> <s>  Hodler contested the argument by  the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it was not directly  involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus  was on former bid chief Thomas Welch. </s> <s>  Yesterday the lawyer of Salt  Lake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not  there any more. </s> <s>  We know nothing. </s> <s> ' My experience is that this is not  true. </s> <s>  The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition  assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC  members by the Salt Lake bid committee. </s> <s>  From 1991 to 1995, the committee  _ under the direction of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships  to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from  Africa. </s> <s>  The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of  the bid committee at the time. </s> <s>  SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was  also a high official on the bid committee. </s> <s>  Hodler said the blame shud  be on those who put pressure on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship  funds. </s> <s>  Nobody blames Salt Lake City, he said. </s> <s>  We blame those  voters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. </s> <s>  They were a victim. </s> <s>   We should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships. </s> <s>  Joklik  on Saturday denied any payment for votes. </s> <s>  I don't even know what  agents are, he said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> IOC official, Marc Hodler, alleges
