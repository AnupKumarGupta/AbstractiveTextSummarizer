article= <d> <p> <s>  The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday, like it or not. </s> <s>   The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field  whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn by the  voters in Tuesday's elections, which delivered a crushing disappointment  to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to  the recently ailing Democrats. </s> <s>  President Clinton called it an astonishing  triumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won  so many major victories because they had a clear message. </s> <s>  Republicans  agreed. </s> <s>  Of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and  many reversals of fortune. </s> <s>  But the election results offered important  guidelines. </s> <s>  Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for  at least three reasons. </s> <s>  He worked furiously and successfully in the  last ten days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists  not to stay home and sulk, appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224  candidates, according to his office. </s> <s>  A moderate within the spectrum  of his own party, he watched moderates win crucial elections, notably  in the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. </s> <s>  Gray Davis, a  cautious pragmatist like Gore, won a smashing victory. </s> <s>  The returns  _ an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain of five in the  House of Representatives _ also made the impeachment of President  Clinton less likely. </s> <s>  And the better shape Clinton is in as his term  ends, the better chance Gore, his sidekick for six years now, stands  in the presidential nomination process and, ultimately, the election. </s> <s>   But California voters also complicated the nominating process and  set Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it, because  he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential  aspirations. </s> <s>  In a referendum in 1996, California adopted a primary  system under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would  all receive the same ballot, with candidates of all parties listed. </s> <s>   That violates the rules of both major parties, and a measure on the  ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded the 1996 change. </s> <s>   But it failed, raising the possibility that California's March 7 primary  will be a mere political popularity poll, with convention delegates  chosen in caucus or convention _ a nightmare. </s> <s>  Tuesday was a bad day  for the Republican right. </s> <s>  High-profile right-wingers lost across the  country, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's  race to Sen. </s> <s>  Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election in North Carolina,  to Rep. </s> <s>  Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate race despite  a huge spending advantage over Sen. </s> <s>  Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey  in Maryland, who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an  unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. </s> <s>  Both conservatives  and moderates in the party said the Republicans had to get back to  basics. </s> <s>  Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that the results should  sober every Republican and called for new strategic thinking. </s> <s>  If  you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval  rating, as they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if the election  goes against you, said Gov. </s> <s>  Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a moderate  whose promoters mention him weekly as a possible vice-presidential  nominee. </s> <s>  Sen. </s> <s>  John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tends to  steer away from divisive social issues, won re-election with 68 per  cent of the vote. </s> <s>  He is studying the possibility of a presidential  race, but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win,  he said in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their  leaders need to learn some lessons. </s> <s>  I just hope this debacle is  a wake-up call for our people, he said. </s> <s>  You've got to be for something  _ smaller government, better education, something. </s> <s>  We're seen as the  party that's against everything. </s> <s>  Polls taken late in this year's  campaign bore McCain out. </s> <s>  They showed that the Republicans are no  longer identified with issues that were once their electoral bread  and butter, such as low taxes and law and order. </s> <s>  Tuesday was also  a fresh demonstration, for anyone who needed one, of the political  utility of pitching a tent big enough for almost everyone. </s> <s>  Black politicians  in North Carolina, Maryland and California reported that their fears  of an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless. </s> <s>  Black votes  proved indispensable to a considerable number of hard-pressed Democratic  candidates, especially where they felt their interests directly threatened. </s> <s>   The figures on Hispanic voting, assembled from exit polls and from  the candidates' own precinct analyses, showed dramatic differences. </s> <s>   In California, where the outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson,  had played the anti-immigration card with a vengeance, both major  Democratic candidates _ Davis and Sen. </s> <s>  Barbara Boxer, who won re-election  after trailing in early polls _ cleaned up among Hispanic voters. </s> <s>   He took 78 percent, she 72. </s> <s>  But both of the Bush brothers, Jeb in  Florida and George W. in Texas, took more than half the Hispanic vote  in their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. </s> <s>  So did McCain. </s> <s>   Jeb Bush is married to a Hispanic woman, he and his brother both speak  Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain has long espoused  Hispanic causes. </s> <s>  Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength,  if they decide to run, from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic  voters, as well as their general electoral strength. </s> <s>  George W. Bush  took 69 percent of the vote in Texas, where a Democrat sat in the  governor's chair only four years ago, and which has the second-largest  bloc of electoral votes. </s> <s>  Florida has the fourth-largest. </s> <s>  Governor  Bush of Texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderates. </s> <s>  A leader  who is compassionate and conservative, he said in his victory speech,  can erase the gender gap and open the Republican party to new faces  and new voices. </s> <s>  But figures on the right saw things differently. </s> <s>   James Dobson, a leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans  had fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen. </s> <s>  Trent Lott of Mississippi,  the majority leader, had caved in to the president on the budget and  de-emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration. </s> <s>   He called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich. </s> <s>  Likewise,  the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate  in 2000, said the leadership will have a lot to answer for. </s> <s>  Tuesday  proved the potency of education as an issue, and suggested that it  will emerge as a major theme of the 2000 campaign. </s> <s>  Clinton, in his  limited involvement in the campaign, and Gore, in his extensive participation,  both stressed Democratic programs to build more schools and hire more  teachers. </s> <s>  Almost a quarter of California voters _ and there are now  almost twice as many voters in California as in any other state _  named education as their most pressing concern. </s> <s>  Elsewhere, Democrats  won the governorships of Alabama and South Carolina against the odds,  partly by emphasizing their rivals' opposition to lotteries that will  help to pay for schools. </s> <s>  In Iowa, a Democrat was elected governor  for the first time since 1969 on a platform that featured the dilapidated  condition of the state's schools and a promise to remedy it. </s> <s>  Tuesday  demonstrated the overriding importance of money in modern American  politics. </s> <s>  Feingold, one of the principal backers of campaign-finance  reform, survived to fight another day, but so did opponents of reform. </s> <s>   And the returns in House races, showing that all but six of 401 members  who sought re-election had won, underlined once again how hard it  is, under the present system, for a challenger to raise enough money  to compete effectively. </s> <s>  The difficulties of raising money may doom  many would-be presidential candidacies. </s> <s>  Gore will have what he needs,  as will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. </s> <s>  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. </s> <s>   But how many others will? </s> <s>  Finally, Tuesday delivered an indecisive  message about impeachment. </s> <s>  Close to two-thirds of voters nationwide  told exit pollsters that they intended to send no message about Clinton,  but they made it clear in response to other questions that they disliked  the House inquiry into the president's alleged misdeeds and wanted  to see it end. </s> <s>  In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska, did a majority  of voters say they favored even a congressional censure of Clinton,  a much milder form of punishment advocated by many Clinton backers. </s> <s>   Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearings at  all in the Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking about  a deal, the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter  to an early close. </s> <s>  Nevertheless, Republican members of the House Judiciary  Committee said they needed to press ahead with the Constitutional  process that the House has set in motion. </s> <s>  Among those taking that  view were Rep. </s> <s>  Bob Barr of Georgia, a fierce foe of the president,  and Rep. </s> <s>  Mary Bono of California, whose tone has been more muted. </s> <s>   But Rep. </s> <s>  David Dreier of California, the incoming Rules Committee  chairman, said that the election has played a role in ensuring that  one of us has a desire to drag that out. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Congressional, gubernatorial election results sobering for Republicans. </s> </p> </d>
