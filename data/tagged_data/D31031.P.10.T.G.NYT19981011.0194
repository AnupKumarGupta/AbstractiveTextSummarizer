article= <d> <p> <s>  Top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the  White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon  with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their  midnight Monday deadline for another day or two. </s> <s>  Both sides were amiable  as they emerged from a two-hour session, but they had little to report  and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared with  the last three nights, should not be interpreted as a sign of crisis  or of imminent peace in the budget talks. </s> <s>  Sunday's discussions focused  on education and President Clinton's request for $1. </s> <s> 1 billion to hire  100,000 teachers, but aides said the bargainers did not delve into  much detail and nothing was resolved. </s> <s>  I think we made some real  progress today, but we still have a significant difference in the  area of education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff  and top negotiator, after Sunday's meeting. </s> <s>  We're going to try to  plow through that over the next two days. </s> <s>  Asked how far apart the  two sides were on education, Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican  majority leader, replied: I don't know. </s> <s>  We're not together. </s> <s>  He  said the two sides had made some progress, but not enough. </s> <s>  The  talks came during another day of escalated political confrontation  as congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they  have three weeks until Election Day, tried to take advantage of the  static budget situation. </s> <s>  Congress has passed only six of the 13 required  spending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final  omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major  issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much  money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions  it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for  items like increased security at U.S. </s> <s>  embassies around the world and  for American farmers. </s> <s>  Also to be resolved are a host of issues that  have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including  environmental matters, contraception and national student testing. </s> <s>   Republicans said the president had been disengaged from the process,  and they were irked at what they said was his swooping in at the 11th  hour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently successful  portrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular topic. </s> <s>  Democrats  countered that the Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year,  and cast the Republicans as extremists for blocking the president's  plea for more money to hire teachers and modernize schools. </s> <s>  In fact,  Republican bargainers said Saturday night that they would provide  the money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how the  money would be used. </s> <s>  Armey was one of many who castigated the president  for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton has  been steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry  in the House. </s> <s>  The scant number of congressional Republicans who did  not leave town for the weekend used the House floor to press this  same message. </s> <s>  What about the president? </s> <s>  asked Rep. </s> <s>  Tom DeLay of  Texas, the majority whip. </s> <s>  Maybe in Martha's Vineyard? </s> <s>  Aspen? </s> <s>  Camp  David? </s> <s>  Where is the president? </s> <s>  I bet the American people don't know  that he spent 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising,  traveling and on vacation. </s> <s>  Republicans said that Clinton had participated  in 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on  Monday in New York, supporting the Senate campaign of Rep. </s> <s>  Charles  Schumer, would bring him to 100. </s> <s>  Clinton said at the White House that  he was prepared to do whatever it takes to reach a resolution  over the spending bills, and dispatched his aides to Capitol Hill. </s> <s>   He also said he would postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon  his departure for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he canceled  a fund-raising appearance in Florida. </s> <s>  But as the high-level budget  bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, both sides agreed they would  need to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary  financing for the government expires for the third time since the  Oct. </s> <s>  1 start of the fiscal year. </s> <s>  Congressional Democrats struck back  at the Republicans, saying they have held a slack schedule themselves. </s> <s>   Rep. </s> <s>  George Miller, D-Calif. </s> <s> , said Congress had been in session only  108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one  consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearings  on the president. </s> <s>  Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more than  225 days. </s> <s>  They say, `Where is the president? </s> <s> ' Miller said. </s> <s>  The  president has been waiting for the budget. </s> <s>  This is the first Congress  since 1974 that has no budget, he said, referring to the broad blueprint  that is supposed to guide spending. </s> <s>  This is a Congress that can't  pass seven of its appropriations bills, he said, largely because  of divisive splits among conservative and moderate Republicans. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Education main topic budget talks; 7 bills needed; ideologies at forefront. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
