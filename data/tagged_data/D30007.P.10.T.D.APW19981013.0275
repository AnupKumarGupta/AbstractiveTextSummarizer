article= <d> <p> <s>  Back in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and was the head  of a 25,000-strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket  of this central African nation. </s> <s>  A quarter of a century later, the  56-year-old businessman who also ran hotels and a tourist camp is  broke; the farmers group is a memory. </s> <s>  Inter-tribal rivalry, looting  soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have  wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea  exports in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green  pastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into  a war zone. </s> <s>  Nobody is making money any more. </s> <s>  People are surviving  on a sack of beans. </s> <s>  They are tired of insecurity and have little hope  things will get better, said Kasuku, the son of an Italian settler  and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. </s> <s>  On Aug. </s> <s>  2, Tutsis, political opponents,  and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army took up  arms, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal  strife. </s> <s>  The war has split Africa's third-largest nation between the  government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political  settlement is in sight. </s> <s>  Goma, a small trading post at the head of  Lake Kivu in eastern Congo, is no longer the starting point for tourists  trekking to see mountain gorillas. </s> <s>  Today, its decaying buildings,  empty shops and crumbling guest houses are home to rebel leaders,  soldiers and people displaced by violence. </s> <s>  The rebels have promised  to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment. </s> <s>  They  also say they will pay civil servants _ who haven't seen a paycheck  in months or years _ and invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms  and gold and diamond-mining concessions. </s> <s>  But the war has also increased  tribal animosity _ especially toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly  successful minority in the eastern region. </s> <s>  In 1990, the liberating  effect of early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes  and led to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus _ who had  settled in eastern Congo since the 1930s. </s> <s>  Mai-Mai warriors _ armed  youths from the Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis of stealing  their land, also joined the fighting. </s> <s>  In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan  refugees engulfed Goma, a town of 30,000. </s> <s>  Among them were former Hutu  soldiers and militiamen who took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring  Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed. </s> <s>  They  brought anti-Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapons to Congolese  tribes, who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi landowners and  ranchers. </s> <s>  People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy,  said Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. </s> <s>  We tried to mediate  between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, but how can you talk to  people who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads? </s> <s>   In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee  camps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees  back home across the border. </s> <s>  After an eight-month rebellion backed  by Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997,  and Kabila took power. </s> <s>  He quickly changed the name of the country  to Congo, from Zaire. </s> <s>  Few people in northeastern Congo expected another  rebellion so soon. </s> <s>  I blame our politicians. </s> <s>  Then I blame the foreign  powers who kept meddling in our affairs. </s> <s>  It is they who supported  Mobutu and Kabila, and we are paying the interest, Kasuku said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Tribal groups fight Congolese President Kabila's government and each other. </s> </p> </d>
