article= <d> <p> <s>  Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether  Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. </s> <s>  The issue was controversial earlier  this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his  aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. </s> <s>  It has  lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically  weaker and has said he will not run again. </s> <s>  The Russian Constitution  has a two-term limit for presidents. </s> <s>  But Yeltsin's aides say his first  term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months  before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution  took effect. </s> <s>  Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's  lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional  Court in February. </s> <s>  While the case has been waiting to be heard, events  have overtaken it. </s> <s>  Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another  term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding  an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the  economic crisis. </s> <s>  The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many  participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that  attracted about 1 million people. </s> <s>  Yeltsin's growing health problems  would also seem to rule out another election campaign. </s> <s>  A respiratory  infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this  week. </s> <s>  On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council,  voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed  narrowly. </s> <s>  Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences,  but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber  made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal  to the president. </s> <s>  Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative  on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore  calls for an early resignation. </s> <s>  The president is a strong person,  and he has been through far more difficult political situations,  Mityukov said, according to the Interfax news agency. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Russian court to decide if Yeltsin could seek a third term. </s> </p> </d>
