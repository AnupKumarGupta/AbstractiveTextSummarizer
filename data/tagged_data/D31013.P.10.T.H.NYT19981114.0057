article= <d> <p> <s>  In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician  in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week  that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility  that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. </s> <s>  The  unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen  Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. </s> <s>   But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian  in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized  violence will be done by the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic  terrorism. </s> <s>  For many in the FBI, that's a problem. </s> <s>  In contrast to the  old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery  on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed  misgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second  she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving  anti-abortion violence. </s> <s>  FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation  could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates  inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes  and unpopular ideas. </s> <s>  Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves  from the old J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of  political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. </s> <s>  They  do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological  war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who  have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against  clinics and doctors. </s> <s>  Many of those calling for government help were  once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights  activists. </s> <s>  Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh,  were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay  as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence  program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate  anti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society  and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. </s> <s>  Some officials  are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions. </s> <s>   They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry  in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. </s> <s>  The  Justice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation;  agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. </s> <s>   But investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics  and staff members. </s> <s>  Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the  problem. </s> <s>  The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield  of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government  militias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists,  animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. </s> <s>  The FBI is  very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political  association, said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. </s> <s>   When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups,  that all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus  gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful  political activity. </s> <s>  In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings  of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building  in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased  efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program. </s> <s>  In  such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement  agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that  require investigators to find a reasonable indication that a group  is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into  an organization. </s> <s>  Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics  as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. </s> <s>   Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat  posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local  authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups. </s> <s>   Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger. </s> <s>   Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by  the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting  along society's frayed margins, off the grid, as some agents describe  it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work. </s> <s>  The profile  fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the  Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. </s> <s>  He has  kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that  he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups. </s> <s>  In contrast,  James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the  killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives. </s> <s>  He was  an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. </s> <s>   Later, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant  anti-abortion group. </s> <s>  One law-enforcement official said that the government  should do what it does best. </s> <s>  We should investigate violations,  he said. </s> <s>  We shouldn't investigate groups. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> FBI, National Clinic Violence Task Force, Slepian, abortion, Cointelpro. </s> </p> </d>
