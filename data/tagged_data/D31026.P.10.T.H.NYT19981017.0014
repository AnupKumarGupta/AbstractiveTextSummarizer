article= <d> <p> <s>  The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. </s> <s>  17: It is  fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude  with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the  aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. </s> <s>  Bedecked in bunting  and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its  aura of history and accomplishment. </s> <s>  That makes it the perfect venue  for part of a championship series that will determine whether the  1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just  a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World  Series. </s> <s>  New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter  of the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem  to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. </s> <s>  The  word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't  measure up against the Yankees. </s> <s>  Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers  in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers  in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn  and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. </s> <s>  But how is that  a match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells,  Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower  Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? </s> <s>  Yet the  truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. </s> <s>  Baseball  fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home  team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that  sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning  the World Series. </s> <s>  The doubts keep creeping up. </s> <s>  The team was pitiful  at the plate through most of the playoffs. </s> <s>  Tino Martinez, the top  run producer, has been in a numbing slump. </s> <s>  Bernie Williams, the American  League batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland  Indians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. </s> <s>  Shane Spencer,  the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be  the new Mr. October. </s> <s>  Pettitte has been struggling since August. </s> <s>  The  curious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular  season than any team in American League history, is how quiet and  unobtrusive it can be. </s> <s>  It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering  clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. </s> <s>  So when  the Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team  might simply fade away. </s> <s>  Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead  in the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency  all season. </s> <s>  New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade  up Broadway. </s> <s>  But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday  night will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season,  an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one  that is remembered. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Yankee Stadium, World Series, Padres, Brown, Ashby, Wells, Martinez. </s> </p> </d>
