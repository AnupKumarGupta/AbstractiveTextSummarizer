article= <d> <p> <s>  When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last  year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing  _ at least for the moment _ a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. </s> <s>   In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles  in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995  _ a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity. </s> <s>   Talk about bad market calls. </s> <s>  Twelve months later, as the same financial  mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through  endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary  Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone  wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since  World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia  that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep  fears over what happens next in Latin America. </s> <s>  What makes this year's  IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticisms  are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the  U.S. </s> <s>  Treasury, which is viewed as the power behind the IMF. </s> <s>  This year,  in place of confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. </s> <s>   Arguments are breaking out over whether the true culprits were crony  capitalists and weakened leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin,  or huge investors who poured money into the world's emerging markets  with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panicked in the past twelve  months. </s> <s>  Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions  of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking the  safest havens possible, often in the United States _ and the money  is not returning anytime soon. </s> <s>  And the subtext of every seminar on  capital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some  painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? </s> <s>  Or is the world headed  for a global recession? </s> <s>  Fifty-three years ago the IMF was created  after the Bretton Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world  economy and secure the peace after World War II. </s> <s>  Now it is under attack  from all sides, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by  misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in  some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia,  to Moscow. </s> <s>  For the first time, there are disturbing questions about  whether the institution itself is still capable, financially or politically,  of containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world  unaware. </s> <s>  Once, the IMF's critics were largely found in Africa and  South Asia, were the fund was often viewed as arrogant; today they  include Wall Street's biggest players and top officials in the most  powerful economies of Asia and Europe. </s> <s>  Only a few _ including former  Secretary of State George Schultz and members of Congress who are  increasingly suspicious of all international institutions _ are talking  about scrapping the IMF altogether. </s> <s>  But almost everyone is talking  about creating a new financial architecture that can do what the  old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap  around the globe. </s> <s>  President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair  and other leaders, after months of silence, have edged into the debate,  in some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance  ministers and central banks. </s> <s>  Their fear, their advisers say, is that  15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. </s> <s>   Such concerns have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass  of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions. </s> <s>  The Japanese,  the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in Washington with  different diagnoses of what went wrong, and different solutions about  how to set it right. </s> <s>  The United States has its own set of plans, a  mix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries  around the world and to impose more American-style financial standards  and regulation. </s> <s>  Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out  over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free  and open markets _ a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration  for the past six years. </s> <s>  Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding  the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables. </s> <s>   Last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down  to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know best,'  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast in Washington  the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 years of astounding  growth in his country into an overnight depression. </s> <s>  Then they said  everything that went wrong was our fault, he said. </s> <s>  But now, now  I think people know that much of the problem came from the outside,  and we need something better. </s> <s>  And the IMF itself is beginning to  fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by Ph.D. </s> <s>   economists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged. </s> <s>  Every  place you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made  things worse, said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director  of the fund, who was born in Northern Rhodesia _ now Zambia _ and  became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics  department before taking a job that has now put him in the center  of the financial storm. </s> <s>  We frequently get the blame, some of it  well-deserved, he said. </s> <s>  But it is politically convenient for governments  around the world to cry, `The IMF made us do it,' and pin their mistakes  on us. </s> <s>  That's fine. </s> <s>  We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd  like to be effective. </s> <s>  MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS  On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official,  slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto  and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the  huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens  of billions of dollars in emergency aid. </s> <s>  Two previous deals had collapsed  when Suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so Camdessus insisted  that he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving  leader. </s> <s>  It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power  politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus  had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering  the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central  bank. </s> <s>  It was all there, a senior IMF official recalled. </s> <s>  He was  told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove  monopoly, all the distribution monopolies. </s> <s>  At one point, Camdessus  looked at the impassive Suharto and said, You see what this means  for your family, a reference to their vast investments in the country's  key industries. </s> <s>  He said, `I called in my children, and they all  understand. </s> <s> ' But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to  symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and  reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical  reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social  costs of its actions. </s> <s>  Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. </s> <s>   It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, a delaying move  that was obvious to everyone except Camdessus. </s> <s>  Perhaps one reason  why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is  almost entirely composed of Ph.D. </s> <s>  economists. </s> <s>  There are few officials  with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities  of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia. </s> <s>  Historically,  experts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations,  development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _  creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one. </s> <s>  As a result, the  fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if  its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly  dissolved. </s> <s>  While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and  their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples  to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands. </s> <s>   To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive  subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. </s> <s>   But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked  the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots  that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs. </s> <s>   The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped Suharto's  resignation, insisting on the elimination of crony capitalism,  code words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the  economy. </s> <s>  Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if  the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese  minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country's  fast-shrinking economy. </s> <s>  It is worth noting, Fischer said this  week, that our programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand  _ only took hold after there was a change in government. </s> <s>  Nonetheless,  the Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the IMF is  so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital  flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs  of its actions. </s> <s>  Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution,  the World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. </s> <s>  You've  seen the tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official  said recently. </s> <s>  The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent  months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce  a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic  chaos. </s> <s>  Even U.N. </s> <s>  Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument,  warning in a speech at Harvard recently that if globalization is  to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. </s> <s>  It must deliver  rights no less than riches. </s> <s>  It must be harnessed to the cause not  of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest  of the world. </s> <s>  IMF officials say they are changing strategies when  they see they are exacting too great a social cost. </s> <s>  It's a very  difficult formula to get exactly right, Fischer said in August,  as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in $4. </s> <s> 8 billion in  aid that was rapidly wasted. </s> <s>  You need enough discipline to send  the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing. </s> <s>   But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than  they otherwise would. </s> <s>  In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed  more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods  in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. </s> <s>  There is a new flexibility at  the IMF a senior Indonesian official concluded recently. </s> <s>  It is  a lot better. </s> <s>  A U.S. </s> <s>  PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? </s> <s>  The Clinton administration  admits that the IMF has many failings, many of them on display this  year. </s> <s>  But it insists that the world has gone through global financial  crises without an IMF once before in this century _ and the result  was the 1930s. </s> <s>  I have no doubt the situation over the past year  would have been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults,  more contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program  agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided, Deputy Treasury  Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. </s> <s>  Many Republicans  and some Democrats are unconvinced. </s> <s>  Even though the Senate has overwhelmingly  approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight  new crises, the House defeated that measure two weeks ago. </s> <s>  The fund's  last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion  in contributions from other nations waiting for the United States  to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget  differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days. </s> <s>  A rejection,  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around  the world that the United States is turning its back on the one institution  charged with restoring economic stability. </s> <s>  Everywhere else in the  world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the  biggest problems with the IMF is that, contrary to the view of Congress,  it acts as the U.S. </s> <s>  Treasury's lap dog. </s> <s>  Ask in Jakarta or Moscow,  and the response is the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking  back for the approving nod of its master. </s> <s>  When the United States weighs  in, however, is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep  trouble. </s> <s>  Only then does the IMF _ and the U.S. </s> <s>  Treasury _ have the  leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid. </s> <s>  In  theory, the U.S. </s> <s>  influence is limited: It has an 18. </s> <s> 5 percent vote  in the fund. </s> <s>  Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent  each. </s> <s>  But in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising  its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer  and Summers. </s> <s>  The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers  was a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a  colleague at MIT. </s> <s>  Each served as chief economist of the World Bank. </s> <s>   It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the fund's  no. </s> <s>  2 job, and these days they talk constantly. </s> <s>  It's usually a warm  relationship, Fischer said this summer. </s> <s>  Remember, this is a job  where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice _ you can't call the  chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic  friends, because so many of the issues are confidential. </s> <s>  The Treasury's  relations with Camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role  of world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political  leaders. </s> <s>  The tensions were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. </s> <s>   The fund made little secret of its displeasure that the United States  was not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major U.S. </s> <s>  ally, as a sign  of support and confidence. </s> <s>  Mindful of the backlash in Congress when  Mexico was bailed out with U.S. </s> <s>  money, that was the last thing the  Treasury planned to do. </s> <s>  Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not  forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough  or disclose their true financial picture. </s> <s>  Within the U.S. </s> <s>  government  there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt  the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when  the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their  own budgets. </s> <s>  There were other conflicts. </s> <s>  When Japan used the last  IMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion Asia Fund _ one  that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid  under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. </s> <s>  Rubin called  up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese  proposal would undercut the IMF's authority. </s> <s>  We've just had a dispute  with Michel, Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange  juice and croissant. </s> <s>  One of them shot back: And it's only 8 a.m. </s> <s>   Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from money  that Asia could have used. </s> <s>  Japan says it will be back with a similar  proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund. </s> <s>  Camdessus  has also rankled U.S. </s> <s>  officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading  to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts. </s> <s>  In June,  with Russia on its way to collapse, Camdessus declared that contrary  to what markets and commentators are imagining about the slow collapse  of Russia's economy, this is not a crisis. </s> <s>  This is not a major development. </s> <s>   The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how  Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S. </s> <s>  strategic  interests are involved. </s> <s>  Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within  days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December,  it sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. </s> <s>   I didn't bother going to the IMF, Kim recalled recently. </s> <s>  I called  Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington  and went directly there. </s> <s>  I knew that was how this would get done. </s> <s>   Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced  veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary  for international affairs this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations  with the government in Seoul. </s> <s>  Fischer was displeased. </s> <s>  To make a  negotiation effective, it has to be clear who has the authority to  do the negotiating, he said. </s> <s>  WHO LOST RUSSIA? </s> <s>  The pattern was repeated  this summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion  package for Russia. </s> <s>  The IMF's staff in Moscow declared that Russia  needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would  restore confidence in investors. </s> <s>  The Americans and Germans came to  a different conclusion. </s> <s>  Soon after, U.S. </s> <s>  officials gathered in the  White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia  if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push  the IMF to come up with emergency money. </s> <s>  So the fund began assembling  a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform  plans for seven years. </s> <s>  Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning  whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. </s> <s>  We had  to pull Michel along, a senior Treasury official recalled. </s> <s>  As it  turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the approach championed  by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. </s> <s>  The first installment  of that payment _ $4. </s> <s> 8 billion _ was wasted, propping up the currency  long enough, in the words of one IMF official, to let the oligarchs  get their money out of the country. </s> <s>  Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments,  let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and  fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a  collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its  aid program. </s> <s>  Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are recriminations  over who lost Russia. </s> <s>  Publicly, Fischer argues that there are  no apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia. </s> <s>  But some IMF  officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod  over them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian  parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments. </s> <s>   Summers responds that the United States took a calculated risk  because it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed. </s> <s>   The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion,  with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge losses in  hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn. </s> <s> , investment  firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money  it had invested. </s> <s>  Russia was a turning point, said Robert Hormats,  the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co. It made the world  realize that some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury  intercede. </s> <s>  And that changed the perception of risk. </s> <s>  Now, as the  countries meet to face a future that the IMF has warned could be very  bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries  slowly starve for lack of capital. </s> <s>  The emerging markets are calling  for controls on short term investments. </s> <s>  The French want a stronger  IMF. </s> <s>  The Americans say the answer is more disclosure, so that investors  are better warned, and tougher regulation. </s> <s>  These are usually nice,  quiet meetings; everyone very polite, a top U.S. </s> <s>  official said earlier  this week. </s> <s>  Not this year. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Background upcoming IMF meeting: contentious, failures, US-West pressures. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
