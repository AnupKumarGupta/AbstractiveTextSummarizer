article= <d> <p> <s>  What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved  into a full-blown international scandal. </s> <s>  The International Olympic  Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of  nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by  the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. </s> <s>  IOC  executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described  as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a bribe. </s> <s>   I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place  to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to  get the vote, Hodler said. </s> <s>  IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch  assigned the international body's juridical commission _ which deals  with legal and ethical issues _ to investigate. </s> <s>  The inquiry will be  headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a highly respected  former World Court judge. </s> <s>  The scholarship fund was first disclosed  two weeks ago by a Salt Lake radio station. </s> <s>  The controversy is now  bound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake  Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to make to the IOC executive  board this weekend. </s> <s>  SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne  Friday, welcomed the IOC investigation. </s> <s>  I think that's who the matter  should be taken up by, he told The Associated Press. </s> <s>   Of course,  we intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and its investigation. </s> <s>   Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's image. </s> <s>   I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now, he said. </s> <s>   Asked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he hadn't  seen the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. </s> <s>  But he sought to  distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between  the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. </s> <s>   Presumably (Hodler's) remarks are related to actions of the bid  commitee before 1995, Joklik said. </s> <s>  The organizing committee certainly  has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any  investigation. </s> <s>  The facts were in the early 1990s when the bid committee  was operating. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John  Krimsky described the controversy as disruptive for Salt Lake's  image and preparations for the games. </s> <s>  It doesn't do us any good  at all, he said. </s> <s>  I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's  review. </s> <s>  I hope it will be a footnote. </s> <s>  I hope it never becomes a chapter. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> IOC, SLOC, Joklik, bribe, 2002 Winter Games, humanitarian aid, Mbaye. </s> </p> </d>
