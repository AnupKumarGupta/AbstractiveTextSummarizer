article= <d> <p> <s>  Two astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to  attach antennas to the international space station under construction  nearly 250 miles above Earth. </s> <s>  For the second time this week, Jerry  Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour  to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open  cargo bay. </s> <s>  Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas  to Unity, the American-made side of the space station. </s> <s>  Their other  job, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna  on Zarya, the Russian-built control module. </s> <s>  The planned seven-hour  spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night's  outing, during which Ross and Newman hooked up 40 electrical connections  between Zarya and Unity. </s> <s>  The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size  antennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides  of the 36-foot cylinder. </s> <s>  Once activated, the antennas will provide  a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity  and NASA's Mission Control. </s> <s>  Otherwise, U.S. </s> <s>  flight controllers would  have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations. </s> <s>   The electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be made  inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the orbiting  station for the first time. </s> <s>  Other spacewalking chores for Ross and  Newman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer  mounted to the outside of Unity. </s> <s>  Mission Control decided just before  the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. </s> <s>   Flight controllers urged caution. </s> <s>  The antenna was rolled up on a spool,  and engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough  force to hurt him if he got too close. </s> <s>  Newman had a 10-foot grappling  hook for the job. </s> <s>  The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly  following Zarya's Nov. </s> <s>  20 launch from Kazakstan. </s> <s>  One more spacewalk  is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman  will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will  be used by future station visitors. </s> <s>  Newman also may try to unjam the  other Zarya antenna. </s> <s>  This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during  his 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for  Newman. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Astronauts to install antennas on Unity chamber, fix Russian antenna. </s> </p> </d>
