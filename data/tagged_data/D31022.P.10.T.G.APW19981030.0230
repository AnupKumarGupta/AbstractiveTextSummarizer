article= <d> <p> <s>  A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween  revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring  about 180. </s> <s>  It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, local  rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing  the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a  city of half a million people on the country's west coast. </s> <s>  The fire  was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people  died in the town of Boraas. </s> <s>  We are still searching the building  . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  but so far we have found 60 dead, Goteborg police official Jan  Edmundson said on national radio. </s> <s>  At a news conference Friday morning,  police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. </s> <s>   The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people  who needed treatment at emergency burn centers. </s> <s>  Binan Atta was walking  to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. </s> <s>  He said he raced  in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. </s> <s>  His  clothes had burned off. </s> <s>  His skin was red and bubbly, Atta said. </s> <s>   Lots of kids were just screaming, he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran  Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. </s> <s>   I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. </s> <s>  They didn't even  look down beforehand. </s> <s>  Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. </s> <s>   (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes  later, rescue workers said. </s> <s>  The blaze was already consuming the two-story  brick building. </s> <s>  The dance was on the second floor. </s> <s>  About 300 or 400  people were inside, police said. </s> <s>  Many escaped on their own. </s> <s>  Police  rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. </s> <s>  The 60th victim died at a hospital. </s> <s>   It was a panic, Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with  youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling  with police to get in and attempt to help friends. </s> <s>  The cause of the  fire was not immediately known. </s> <s>  What we know is that there was an  explosion, Edmundson said. </s> <s>  Olin said there were signs that the fire  was set. </s> <s>  The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not  a normal fire, he said. </s> <s>  The Swedish news agency TT reported 190  people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in  intensive care. </s> <s>  Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter  to burn clinics in other cities, the report said. </s> <s>  Goteborg is about  500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. </s> <s>  The  fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the  local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance. </s> <s>  The crowd  in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year  olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. </s> <s>  A night full of  expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits  in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into  a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions, the Goteborg city council  said in a statement. </s> <s>  Goteborg is today a city in shock. </s> <s>  Jamal  Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze  started with about 400 people inside. </s> <s>  It looked like it started  in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor, he  was quoted as saying. </s> <s>  It was chaos. </s> <s>  Everybody was trying to get  out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. </s> <s>  . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>   Others kicked out the windows and jumped out. </s> <s>  Ambulances were called  in from several nearby communities. </s> <s>  The Goteborg rescue services also  brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. </s> <s>  Olin  said the rescue service inspected the building in April 1997 and fulfilled  all possible demands as far as emergency exits and the possibility  for fast evacuation. </s> <s>  Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital,  where many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them  was difficult. </s> <s>  Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they  are . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that  of a friend who is a year older. </s> <s>  Girls don't carry their identification  on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,  she said, according to TT. </s> <s>  Goteborg has about 435,000 people. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Scores of teenagers killed in Goteborg, Sweden, dance hall fire; arson? </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
