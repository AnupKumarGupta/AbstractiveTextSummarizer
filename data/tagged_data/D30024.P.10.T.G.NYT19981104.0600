article= <d> <p> <s>  Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional  Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for  their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an  off-year election. </s> <s>  The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility  of congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results  showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold  over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the  House. </s> <s>  The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that  the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and  it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. </s> <s>   The Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political  year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair  with Monica Lewinsky. </s> <s>  The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming  a Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent,  amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled  Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until  they captured it again in 1994. </s> <s>  With attention now shifting to the  House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. </s> <s>  Henry  Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday  that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the  independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. </s> <s>  Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers  he hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment  by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands  and put it into Gingrich's. </s> <s>  Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday  until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. </s> <s>  Trying to put  the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta,  Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections  in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. </s> <s>  But furious  rank and file Republicans burned up the phone lines to each other,  discussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers  in the next few weeks. </s> <s>  We've got to reach out and have more than  southern white males running the Washington Republican Party, said  Rep. </s> <s>  Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. </s> <s>  He said that Republicans  this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. We  need an agenda first of all, he said. </s> <s>  We went an entire calendar  year without an agenda. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut  called the election a devastating loss and said simply, There are  going to be major changes in our leadership. </s> <s>  All segments of our party  want to see change. </s> <s>  At the White House, Clinton called the election  results a vindication of his party's policies. </s> <s>  If you look at all  the results, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. </s> <s>  The American  people want their business, their concerns, their children, their  families, their future addressed here. </s> <s>  That's what the message of  the election was. </s> <s>  One of the first difficult questions now facing  Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face  of public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican  majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes  required for impeachment cannot be assembled. </s> <s>  In a public statement  released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues to have a  clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious  manner. </s> <s>  Our duty has not changed because the constitution has not  changed. </s> <s>  But Sen. </s> <s>  Robert Torricelli, D-N. </s> <s> J. </s> <s> , said the election results  guaranteed that impeachment will fail. </s> <s>  I think any serious effort  to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over, he  said. </s> <s>  It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on  an exit strategy. </s> <s>  From the other side of the aisle, Rep. </s> <s>  Rick Lazio,  a Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped up  expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate  future. </s> <s>  For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control  of the House with 228 seats and to find consensus among their party's  competing factions. </s> <s>  With their numbers reduced, the Republican leadership  will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core  conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with  a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. </s> <s>   The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held by an indepenndent. </s> <s>   Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. </s> <s>  The  new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate  Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking control away  from Republican leaders. </s> <s>  Already seeing some of the possibilities,  Rep. </s> <s>  Peter King of Long Island, N.Y. </s> <s> , said northeastern Republicans  would be strengthened. </s> <s>  It gives us much more leverage with the leadership  and makes it easier to protect New York, he said. </s> <s>  It's going to  weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast  conservatives. </s> <s>  Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election  gains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40. </s> <s>  Seeming uncharacteristically  uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the results. </s> <s>   Things were happening out there that none of us fully understand--neither  party in my judgment, he said. </s> <s>  Taking his share of the blame for  his party's losses, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how  the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the  modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican  themes. </s> <s>  I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people  would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio  and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of  disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. </s> <s>  And as a result I think  we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a  much stronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security,  winning the war on drugs, reforming education and national defense. </s> <s>   Majority Leader Sen. </s> <s>  Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes,  saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final  96 hours of the campaign. </s> <s>  He also conceded that Congress' final scramble  to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. </s> <s>  One of this lessons  for Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully  to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise  message that we do apply across the nation, he said in Washington. </s> <s>   Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next  year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. </s> <s>  Even  as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were  making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against  the Republican leaders who have steered the Congress since the Republican's  assumed control four years ago. </s> <s>  One senior Republican staffer said  the House had become a tinderbox of intrigue. </s> <s>  Scarborough said,  The long distance charges in Washington offices probably are going  through the roof today. </s> <s>  Everybody's calling everybody. </s> <s>  Everybody recognizes  that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans  when Republican governors are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts,  Florida and Texas. </s> <s>  And while Gingrich has not gone out of his way  to identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad  blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible. </s> <s>   Gingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt  against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership  team in the summer of 1997. </s> <s>  Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. </s> <s>   But with House leadership elections now set for mid-November, Republicans  said this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological  lines to moderates like Shays as well. </s> <s>  We got shellacked, said  Rep. </s> <s>  Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. </s> <s>  We beat ourselves  because we had no agenda. </s> <s>  Republicans were discussing possible challenges  to Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey, and other members  of the senior leadership team. </s> <s>  Some were envisioning trying to run  an entire new ticket headed by Rep. </s> <s>  Bob Livingston, the Appropriations  Committee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. </s> <s>  Steve Largent,  an Oklahoma conservative. </s> <s>  Asked whether Tuesday's election results  could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly  concerned. </s> <s>  Republicans close to him said they expected the anger  to dissipate. </s> <s>  In the Senate, where leadership races take place in  early December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges  against mid-level leadership figures. </s> <s>  Several senators expressed particular  pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of  Kentucky, who poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying  to defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell  Feingold of Wisconsin. </s> <s>  Feingold won in a close race. </s> <s>  Some lawmakers  on Wednesday approached Sen. </s> <s>  Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he  would replace McConnell. </s> <s>  Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than  eight senators, and was considering whether to challenge McConnell. </s> <s>   Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. </s> <s>   This is a big loss for us, he said. </s> <s>  We squandered a very historic  opportunity last night. </s> <s>  To just break even is a loss. </s> <s>  Most incumbents  coasted to victory Tuesday night. </s> <s>  But some will not be returning. </s> <s>   Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas,  Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of  New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. </s> <s>  One Democrat also lost his  re-election bid _ Rep. </s> <s>  Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. </s> <s>  The new House members  include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. </s> <s>  David Wu, a Democrat  was leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House  seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement was not expected  until Friday after absentee ballots are counted. </s> <s>  Unlike the self-proclaimed  revolutionaries of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly  elected members are career politicians who rose through the ranks  of local and state government. </s> <s>  Three of the Democrats are the sons  of former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who  represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall  brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior,  and Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his father, Henry. </s> </p> </d>	abstract=
