article= <d> <p> <s>  The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the  first inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the  first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball  last Wednesday. </s> <s>  There were no boos. </s> <s>  It was a very warm ovation. </s> <s>  They  liked him. </s> <s>  They really liked him. </s> <s>  Knoblauch exhaled. </s> <s>  Knoblauch had  emphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and  rumbling into the World Series, not about the fans. </s> <s>  But it surely  made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven  him. </s> <s>  Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch  and he could play second base without earplugs. </s> <s>  When the Yankees defeated  the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second  World Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved  player on the field. </s> <s>  The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2  would be forgotten. </s> <s>  The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch  was celebrating as much as anyone. </s> <s>  To have them act like that toward  me was tremendous, said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. </s> <s>   It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out. </s> <s>  Knoblauch  was wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American  League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke. </s> <s>  He did  not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot  by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are  expected not to make. </s> <s>  Just to face things and take it like a man  and answer all the questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch  said. </s> <s>  You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from  something like that. </s> <s>  That's basically what I learned. </s> <s>  If the Yankees  had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that  he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball  that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside  the baseline. </s> <s>  Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead  run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. </s> <s>  Now Knoblauch can  watch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy. </s> <s>   That's huge for him, David Cone said. </s> <s>  That's huge for me. </s> <s>  I  let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one  if they would have come back and beat us. </s> <s>  And Knobbie, I'm sure he's  feeling a lot better now. </s> <s>  Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats,  was working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters  were allowed into the clubhouse. </s> <s>  He flashed the sort of smile that  he had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in  the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about  his mistake. </s> <s>  Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that, Derek  Jeter said. </s> <s>  I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something  good. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Yankee fans forgive Knoblauch error after American League Championship win. </s> </p> </d>
