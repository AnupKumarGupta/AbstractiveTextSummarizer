article= <d> <p> <s>  As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the  Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night,  he wants to do it with a free mind. </s> <s>  Free of worrying about his extremely  uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made  this post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing. </s> <s>  But it is  not easy to keep the mind uncluttered. </s> <s>  Williams does not know if he  will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season,  because he wants to test free agency. </s> <s>  There is a good chance the Yankees  will not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be  forced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation  in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a  familiar situation in the Bronx. </s> <s>  Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared  his client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season,  so that price tag has surely escalated after Williams won the American  League batting title with a . </s> <s> 339 average while drilling 26 homers  and knocking in 97 runs. </s> <s>  Williams was asked if he agreed with the  theory that other teams will outbid the Yankees. </s> <s>  I do not know,  said Williams, who has been aloof during this post-season, but has  declined to discuss why. </s> <s>  And I'm thinking about this a little more  than I would like to. </s> <s>  I would like to keep my focus on the series. </s> <s>   It is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study Saturday  or in the coming days, because the team is four victories away from  a championship. </s> <s>  Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees  as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general  manager Brian Cashman. </s> <s>  It's a tough thing, Cashman said about  balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality  of trying to re-sign Williams. </s> <s>  You know the ugliness of the future  is right in front of you. </s> <s>  Although Williams has been adamant about  not discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday. </s> <s>  When a reporter  asked him what the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees,  Williams' answer included an escape clause. </s> <s>  Just the fact that I've  been here my whole career, Williams said. </s> <s>  That has a lot to do  with it. </s> <s>  The relationships that I've come to know during the years,  I think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch  somewhere else. </s> <s>  Williams continued: But I think the reality of  the game in this day and age is things happen. </s> <s>  You can't really write  things in stone that they're going to happen. </s> <s>  People get traded. </s> <s>  People  become free agents and go to other teams. </s> <s>  I have to make a decision  really thinking about all the people I'm accountable for. </s> <s>  When Williams  was asked what better situation could a player have than being the  center fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being  in the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped. </s> <s>  Wow, that's pretty  good right there, Williams said. </s> <s>  It's funny you mention that,  because I really haven't thought about any of that. </s> <s>  I think, at some  point in the off season, I was going to sit down and think, wow, it  wasn't a bad year at all. </s> <s>  While Cashman would not discuss financial  matters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams  as much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous  after a possible championship. </s> <s>  It is more likely that the Yanks would  offer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. </s> <s>  I'd hate to have  to speculate on something at this point, Cashman said. </s> <s>  We'll give  it our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. </s> <s>   Hopefully, that will be enough. </s> <s>  Then we'll have a marriage. </s> <s>  If not,  we'll have a divorce. </s> <s>  While Williams has earned the right to become  a free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants,  he has interesting choices to make. </s> <s>  When a reporter asked Williams  how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less  from the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he  likes his teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the  post-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer. </s> <s>   My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start  thinking about that, Williams said. </s> <s>  If I start thinking about  that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series. </s> <s>   Williams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable  season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that. </s> <s>  But,  with Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the next four to  seven games would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year  association with the Yankees. </s> <s>  I don't want to talk about that,  Williams said. </s> <s>  I'm going to have a lot of fun out there. </s> <s>  I'm going  to go all out. </s> <s>  Then Williams walked away from the interview. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Center fielder Bernie Williams future with the Yankees
