article= <d> <p> <s>  White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's  largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse  Sen. </s> <s>  Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group  to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. </s> <s>  Charles  Schumer. </s> <s>  Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights  Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the  closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. </s> <s>   They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. </s> <s>  But privately,  organization officials and gay activists from both parties who have  been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse  D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. </s> <s>  They also raised the  possibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain  neutral. </s> <s>  If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on  the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three  major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching  for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's  recent record on gay issues to be quite strong. </s> <s>  An endorsement by  the group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters,  could prove important in swinging voters to D'Amato in a tight race. </s> <s>   It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who has  sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use  the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters. </s> <s>   A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray  the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many  voters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that has  included black and gay voters, women and labor unions. </s> <s>  The intensity  of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance  of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see  defeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the  Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a  Democratic filibuster. </s> <s>  The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. </s> <s>   There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get  60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically  for the next two years, said David Mixner, a close friend of President  Clinton's who is gay. </s> <s>  He was referring to the Senate majority leader,  who has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. </s> <s>   Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest  gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. </s> <s>   Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very  close to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its board  and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors. </s> <s>  Largely  because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New  York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is  even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also runs on the Right to  Life and Conservative Party lines and often receives high ratings  from the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation  on civil rights for gay people. </s> <s>  Although the organization has been  thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the  lobbying campaign for Schumer has picked up intensity in the last  two weeks, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer  than ever. </s> <s>  Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights  for gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton  and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made  personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not  to endorse D'Amato. </s> <s>  White House officials said they did not know whether  the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials  declined to comment. </s> <s>  Schumer met privately with the group's top officials  last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. </s> <s>  Clinton administration  officials have also been buttonholing the group's board members at  every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising  concerns about a D'Amato endorsement. </s> <s>  Some New York advocates of civil  rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls,  e-mail messages and letters. </s> <s>  Democratic officials have been encouraging  the group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato. </s> <s>  People  involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they are hoping  the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at  all. </s> <s>  Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are  important to gay communities, said a senior White House official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </s> <s>  The last thing that they  should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so  supportive of their agenda. </s> <s>  The Human Rights Campaign is considered  the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with  a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than  $13 million. </s> <s>  The group was created in the early 1980s in large part  to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. </s> <s>  Paradoxically,  D'Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained  a strong supporter of President Reagan. </s> <s>  For D'Amato, who has aggressively  courted gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement  in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate. </s> <s>  Since 1993, the  senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military,  sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers  and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations  of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. </s> <s>   To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign  would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help  the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close  to the Democratic Party. </s> <s>  Those who support a D'Amato endorsement,  including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend  that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain  to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must  build alliances with moderate Republicans. </s> <s>  Human Rights Campaign officials  also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents,  even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues. </s> <s>   That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human  Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's. </s> <s>  Both  men, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting  for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages. </s> <s>   In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization  endorsed Sen. </s> <s>  John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger,  William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's  record on gay rights was considered stronger. </s> <s>  The move angered gay  Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that  the group is biased toward Democrats. </s> <s>  But there is clearly a large  number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who  strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group,  particularly among women. </s> <s>  They fear that abortion rights supporters  will quit the group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in  his opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress. </s> <s>  Many New York  gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato,  whom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph  Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay. </s> <s>  Matt Foreman, executive  director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as  the architect of the state Republican Party as a major reason  the group endorsed Schumer. </s> <s>  While he has criticized fellow Republicans  in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's  blatant discrimination is still the order of the day, Foreman said. </s> <s>   For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human  Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless  among gay voters. </s> <s>  They contend that it might even hurt the senator  among his conservative base. </s> <s>  I don't think anybody will vote for  Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement, said a White House aide  who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </s> <s>  But I think some people  in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say,  `Who is this guy and why should we vote for him? </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Gay and lesbian group lobbied to support Democrat in New York Senate race. </s> </p> </d>
