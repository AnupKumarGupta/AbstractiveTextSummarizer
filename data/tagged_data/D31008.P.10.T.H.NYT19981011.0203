article= <d> <p> <s>  As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after  a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as Wyoming's  hometown, wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men. </s> <s>  On Saturday,  at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, Pistol  Pete and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger  group of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying  signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who  suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week. </s> <s>  Hate is not  a Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil, read one sign, as  watchers applauded. </s> <s>  With passersby spontaneously joining the protest  group, two women held another sign that read, No Hate Crimes in  Wyoming. </s> <s>  Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches  near the campus. </s> <s>  At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo. </s> <s> ,  where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has  received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets  to other patients. </s> <s>  A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew  about 500 people. </s> <s>  We live in the Equality State, Shannon Rexroat  wrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus  newspaper. </s> <s>  Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state  to grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's  editor added: That means nothing to me anymore. </s> <s>  We live in a state  where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay. </s> <s>  But others  recalled another side of Wyoming's hometown,which has a population  of more than 26,000. </s> <s>  Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday  he was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed  away from him and used an anti-gay epithet. </s> <s>  Last week's brutal assault  bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and  lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published  Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. </s> <s>  This  incident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying  motive, wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. </s> <s>  Gay people in  Laramie, they wrote, are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance,  insult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes. </s> <s>  Ric Turley, who dropped  out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving  here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized  billboard on the main highway. </s> <s>  Under a brace of pistols, an advertising  appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from  Shoot a Day or Two, to Shoot a Gay or Two. </s> <s>  Turley, who is  gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that  he immediately complained to the museum. </s> <s>  But returning a month later,  he found the message had not been erased. </s> <s>  After complaining to the  museum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint  and blotted out the word gay. </s> <s>  It was this kind of complacency  and apathy that allowed this to happen, he said of the beating in  which two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron  McKinney. </s> <s>  According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men  lured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. </s> <s>  Then, the Laramie  police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a  . </s> <s> 357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until  a passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious. </s> <s>  On Sunday,  the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday  at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated. </s> <s>   McKinney was being treated for a minor skull fracture unrelated  to the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. </s> <s>   President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, I  was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew  Shepard. </s> <s>  Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes  Prevention Act, saying, There is nothing more important to the future  of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice  and violent bigotry. </s> <s>  Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have  a hate crime law. </s> <s>  The latest attempt died in the state Legislature  in Cheyenne in February. </s> <s>  On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer,  said he was outraged and sickened by the attack. </s> <s>  Here in Laramie,  McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack. </s> <s>  His pickup truck  was apparently used in the kidnapping. </s> <s>  But he also complained about  the massive attention by the national media. </s> <s>  The national press blew  it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual, McKinney  told The Denver Post. </s> <s>  `Had this been a heterosexual these two boys  decided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national  news. </s> <s>  Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high  school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was transferred  to Saudi Arabia. </s> <s>  The young man completed high school at a boarding  school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. </s> <s>   On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement  from Fort Collins thanking the American public for their kind thoughts  about Matthew. </s> <s>  He is a trusting person who takes everybody at  face value and he does not see the bad side of anyone, the Shepards  wrote. </s> <s>  He has always strongly felt that all people are the same,  regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion. </s> <s>  Noting  that their son was born prematurely and that his life has often  been a struggle, they added, He is physically short in stature,  but we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth  of others. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d>
