article= <d> <p> <s>  Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured  Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting  him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism. </s> <s>  Kurds in  Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes  in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader. </s> <s>  Kurds came to  Rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong  protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held  under tight security. </s> <s>  If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, he'll  be tortured for certain, said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter  among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. </s> <s>  And  very possibly he'll be killed. </s> <s>  Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the  Rome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where  he had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria. </s> <s>  He leads  the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting  for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. </s> <s>  The conflict  has killed nearly 37,000 people. </s> <s>  To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's  most-wanted criminal. </s> <s>  If Western European nations open their arms  (to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,  Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. </s> <s>  If Italy  continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening  its doors to terrorism, Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling  of brawls that broke out during the first day of protests Saturday  outside the Rome military hospital. </s> <s>  The protest in Rome was peaceful  Sunday. </s> <s>  Elsewhere in Europe, dozens of Kurds protested in Bucharest  until chased away by police; 1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving  pictures of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents  outside Parliament and declared a hunger strike. </s> <s>  In Turkey, four Kurdish  prison inmates were in critical condition after setting themselves  on fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association  said. </s> <s>  Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened  opposition in Italy to his extradition. </s> <s>  Although there have been no  executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to  extradite anyone if there were even a risk of capital punishment. </s> <s>   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting  of European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would tell Italian  Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that we expect a serious and fair  approach. </s> <s>  He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who  reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. </s> <s>  To  announce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even  begun does not go hand in hand with justice, Cem told reporters  before departing. </s> <s>  Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated  to reporters in Rome that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's  billions of dollars of defense contracts if it fails to turn over  the Kurd. </s> <s>  In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that  the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a clear  and responsible manner. </s> <s>  It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's  extradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany, he said. </s> <s>   In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian prisoner  hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. </s> <s>  Metris prison  officials said the jail director was talking to the inmate captors. </s> <s>   Ocalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. </s> <s>  He turned the group  toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor Kurds  in the underdeveloped southeast. </s> <s>  The Turkish army claims to have all  but wiped out the PKK within Turkey but the rebels have havens in  Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Turkey presses Italy to return Kurd, threatens retaliation; demonstrations. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
