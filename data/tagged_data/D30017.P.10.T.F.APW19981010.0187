article= <d> <p> <s>  Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year  than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. </s> <s>  aid official said Saturday. </s> <s>   North Korea needs a minimum 4. </s> <s> 5 million to 5 million tons of grain  to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just  2. </s> <s> 8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program  said. </s> <s>  Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for  this year are that the harvest will not be any better, Ngongi  told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea. </s> <s>  It may be  worse than last year. </s> <s>  Poor harvests, economic collapse and three  years of floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages  in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid. </s> <s>  Fertilizer  is lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, meaning  most planting and harvesting must be done by hand. </s> <s>  Every year it  gets worse, Ngongi said. </s> <s>  But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi  said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to  which the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people  who can get aid from 6. </s> <s> 7 million to 5. </s> <s> 8 million. </s> <s>  Most of those receiving  WFP aid are children aged between 6 months and 6 years. </s> <s>  Ngongi said  the government cited security concerns _ notably the lack of a peace  treaty with its rival South Korea _ for its decision. </s> <s>  The government  said the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. </s> <s>  Ngongi, who spent four  days inspecting WFP relief efforts in North Korea, said people generally  looked better than during a visit last year. </s> <s>  But he also said he could  see that a large part of the population is very weak. </s> <s>  Everybody  has been consuming at a very low level. </s> <s>  So they may not be severely  malnourished, but they are not well nourished at all, he said. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>   officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of North Korea  this summer said 2 million people may have died because of famine. </s> <s>   Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10 or  11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old. </s> <s>  About 30 percent  of children in one primary school he visited were not in class. </s> <s>  A  lot of the children were too weak to come to school, he said. </s> <s>  But  Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives. </s> <s>  A lot of people are  alive today thanks to the international community's support, he  said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> North Korean harvest no better this year. </s> <s>  Government cuts food aid. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
