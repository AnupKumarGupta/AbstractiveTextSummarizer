article= <d> <p> <s>  A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators  has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the  White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with  House Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders. </s> <s>  On Monday,  White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried  to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for  six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees  the Census Bureau. </s> <s>  The deal would put off until next March the contentious  issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to  supplement traditional methods of counting people. </s> <s>  Bowles told the  group of Democrats that the House Republicans were willing to give  on a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement  on the budget, but that they were digging in their heels when it came  to financing the census for six months. </s> <s>  The Democrats met in the office  of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. </s> <s>  The rationale for the half-year  financing is that by next March the Supreme Court is expected to rule  on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. </s> <s>  The Supreme  Court has already agreed to review two lower court rulings that said  sampling would violate federal law. </s> <s>  Oral arguments on the cases are  set for November. </s> <s>  But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months'  financing for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed  sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve  money for a census that included sampling. </s> <s>  The general feeling among  many Democrats was that even if we won the case, there would be a  lot less leverage in March, especially if it was the only issue left  to be debated, said a House Democratic official who insisted on  anonymity. </s> <s>  Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans,  while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign. </s> <s>   Rep. </s> <s>  Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif. </s> <s> , who attended the meeting Monday,  said, It was, sort of, this is where we are. </s> <s>  We've been able to  accomplish great things, what do you think? </s> <s>  We made it very clear  that unless the census was included, along with some other issues,  like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable. </s> <s>  Statistical  sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that  are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting  of African-Americans in cities and blacks and Hispanics in rural areas,  groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means. </s> <s>   Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would raise  the count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas, giving  the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts  are drawn following the 2000 census. </s> <s>  At Monday's meeting, the Democrats  reminded administration officials that Clinton had promised that he  would veto any legislation that restricted the Census Bureau's ability  to conduct an accurate census. </s> <s>  I can't think of any way that restricts  the census more than not to fully fund it, said Rep. </s> <s>  Carolyn Maloney,  D-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s>  The willingness of House Democrats, including Gephardt, to  press the president on the issue represents a realization of their  leverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the coming  impeachment inquiry. </s> <s>  Gephardt is a major player now, and the irony  is we helped make him that, said Rep. </s> <s>  Christopher Shays, R-Conn. </s> <s> ,  who supports the use of sampling in the census. </s> <s>  The Democrats' position  also indicates how little trust many have in the White House on this  issue. </s> <s>  The proposal to finance the departments of Commerce, Justice  and State for six months is similar to one reached last November between  Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. </s> <s>  The idea then was that holding  all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum  pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling. </s> <s>   But House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck  and later grumbled about it. </s> <s>  At a meeting of the Democratic caucus  Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the White  House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm  on the census and that she believed him, a participant said. </s> <s>  The statement  was greeted with laughter. </s> <s>  There is a certain level of suspicion  because there have been times when we have been cut out,said the  House Democratic official. </s> <s>  But I have to say, there hasn't been  much evidence of that, this time. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Statistical sampling in 2000 census snags budget bill; 6-month money an out. </s> </p> </d>
