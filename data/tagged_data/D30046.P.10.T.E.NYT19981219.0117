article= <d> <p> <s>  Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to  censure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William  Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate  to try him, convict him and remove him from office. </s> <s>  But even before  the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's  resignation. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month  by his party, startled the House when he announced he would not run  for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years of service. </s> <s>   He urged the president to heal the wounds that you have created. </s> <s>   You, sir, may resign your post. </s> <s>  Angry Democrats booed and shouted,  You resign! </s> <s>  Livingston continued, I can only challenge you in  such fashion if I am willing to heed my own words. </s> <s>  Apologizing again  for extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, he said, I believe  I had it in me to do a fine job. </s> <s>  But I cannot do that job or be the  kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances. </s> <s>   Then he bolted from the House chamber, nearly knocking reporters and  members down. </s> <s>  (The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article  of impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a federal  grand jury. </s> <s>  The vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. </s> <s>  EST, leaving the 42nd  president to face trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed  from office. </s> <s> ) Clinton rejected the advice immediately. </s> <s>  His spokesman,  Joe Lockhart, said, The president has no intention of resigning. </s> <s>   By calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more  broadly against resignation under fire. </s> <s>  Perhaps speaking to both cases,  Lockhart said, It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics  of personal destruction. </s> <s>  Unless Clinton changes course, this would  be only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history  of the Republic, and the first since Andrew Johnson was acquitted  in 1868. </s> <s>  Sen. </s> <s>  Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has  insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. </s> <s>   But the Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal. </s> <s>  Considering  the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling the two-thirds  majority required under the Constitution for conviction is most unlikely. </s> <s>   Sixty-seven votes would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans  in the Senate, along with 45 Democrats. </s> <s>  Four articles of impeachment  before the House charged Clinton with perjury in lying about his affair  with Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on Aug. </s> <s>  17. </s> <s>  He was  also charged with perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit,  obstruction of justice and abuse of power. </s> <s>  The Republican argument,  over and over, was that Clinton had lied in denying having sexual  relations with Ms. Lewinsky. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey of Texas, the majority  leader, said, A nation of laws cannot be ruled by a person who breaks  the law. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said: There can be  no justice without the truth. </s> <s>  That is just profoundly so, and that  is why perjury matters. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the  Democrats' arguments by saying, What the president did was wrong,  both personally and morally, but his acts did not threaten our democracy  and thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined  by our founding fathers in our Constitution. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Charles Schumer,  New York's senator-elect, said: The rule of law requires that the  punishment fit the crime. </s> <s>  Allow us to vote for censure. </s> <s>  Saturday's  votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between  Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face  of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. </s> <s>  9, 1974. </s> <s>  But while that  case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the  Watergate complex, this one began with a murky land deal in Arkansas  in 1978. </s> <s>  Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel  under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation  spread to examine Clinton's affair with a White House intern. </s> <s>  All  year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnect  with public opinion; since the scandal became public in January, polls  have shown that the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry  brought to an end. </s> <s>  Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a  CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their  representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote. </s> <s>   The conflict now enters uncharted seas, since the Nixon resignation  cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in a different  America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion  polls. </s> <s>  But the capital was still rife with confident speculation. </s> <s>   Some guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which  showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the  nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star  witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. </s> <s>  Others thought the Republicans,  seeing dismal numbers in polls about their party's standing in the  United States, would be the first to blink. </s> <s>  With a majority in the  Senate, they have the power to end a trial at any time after the Senate  receives notice of impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. </s> <s>  6, or  the next day. </s> <s>  But while Clinton has focused on the polls, and the  CBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling  of his job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject  him to criminal prosecution. </s> <s>  And Republicans have steadfastly ignored  the polls all year, and confronted them directly on Saturday. </s> <s>  Representative  J.C. </s> <s>  Watts of Oklahoma, newly elected as chairman of the Republican  caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. </s> <s>  You say polls are  against this. </s> <s>  Polls measure changing feelings, not steadfast principle. </s> <s>   Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. </s> <s>  Polls would have embraced  slavery and ridiculed women's rights. </s> <s>  You say we must draw this  to a close. </s> <s>  I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not  with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big  fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. </s> <s>  And we must do it so every kid in America  can see it. </s> <s>  The point is not whether the president can prevail, but  whether truth can prevail. </s> <s>  Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee  recommended the four articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still  hoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who  were uncommitted. </s> <s>  As the week wore on, almost all of them broke against  the president. </s> <s>  One who did not, Rep. </s> <s>  Christopher Shays of Connecticut,  said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September,  and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I concluded  that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the proven offenses  were not impeachable. </s> <s>  But the president's continued failure to come  to grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members  of the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change  of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally  opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful  opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who  wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position. </s> <s>   He added: Yesterday morning, before I visited with the president,  I concluded that my original position was the correct one, for me. </s> <s>   I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven, and  that the proven offenses are not impeachable. </s> <s>  But Rep. </s> <s>  Tom DeLay  of Texas, who has led the Republican effort to force Clinton from  office, dismissed his and other arguments as moral relativism. </s> <s>  He  began by praising Livingston: There is no greater American in my  mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he understood what  this debate was all about. </s> <s>  It was about honor and decency and integrity  and the truth; everything that we honor in this country. </s> <s>  It was also  a debate about relativism vs. </s> <s>  absolute truth. </s> <s>  He continued, The  president's defenders have said that the president is morally reprehensible,  that he is reckless, that he has violated the trust of the American  people, lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored  the office which they have entrusted him, and that _ but that doesn't  rise to the level of impeachment. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Jose Serrano of New York  said, My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and  they're praying for him right at this very moment. </s> <s>  You may have the  votes today to impeach him, but you don't have the American people. </s> <s>   And let me tell you something, I grew up in the public housing projects  of the South Bronx. </s> <s>  I can see a bunch of bullies when I see them. </s> <s>   The bullies get theirs, and you're going to get yours, too. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Henry  Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman who brought the  charges to the House floor, said the Congress and the American people  needed to distinguish between private acts of infidelity and public  acts by public officials. </s> <s>  In Clinton's case, he said, the House was  dealing with a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement  officer. </s> <s>  He said that the Senate could be innovative and creative  in deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House was bound  by the Constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment. </s> <s>  Justice  is so important to the most humble among us, Hyde said. </s> <s>  Equal  justice under the law _ that's what we're fighting for. </s> <s>  Democrats,  reading from the same Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite  conclusions, and attacked the fairness of the proceedings that culminated  Saturday. </s> <s>  We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes,  said Rep. </s> <s>  Jerrold Nadler, D-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s>  We're lowering the standards of  impeachment. </s> <s>  What the president has done is not a great and dangerous  offense to the republic. </s> <s>  Democrats also criticized Republicans for  impeaching Clinton at the very moment that U.S. </s> <s>  troops waged war against  Iraq. </s> <s>  Six days before Christmas our troops are in battle, and a  lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in chief,  said Rep. </s> <s>  David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat. </s> <s>   The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber. </s> <s>  One Republican  cited the parallels between the charges the House Judiciary Committee  brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the counts that the same committee  brought to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday. </s> <s>  Nixon cheated. </s> <s>   He cheated the electoral system, said Rep. </s> <s>  Lindsey Graham, a South  Carolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee. </s> <s>  And now, Graham said,  the full House is voting to impeach Clinton because we believe he  committed crimes that result in cheating our judicial system. </s> <s>  But  most of the day's debate was firmly rooted in Clinton's effort to  conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Bob Barr, a Georgia  Republican on the Judiciary Committee who is one of Clinton's fiercest  critics, held up copies of the U.S. </s> <s>  Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's  report on the impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution,  in defending his decision to impeach the president. </s> <s>  Today, we rely  on the three pillars of our society: the law itself, evidence and  the Constitution, said Barr. </s> <s>  There is no joy in upholding the  law, Watts said. </s> <s>  If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot  recognize it. </s> <s>  How can we tell our children honesty is the best policy  when we don't demand it as a policy? </s> <s>  But Democrats assailed the  very premise on which the Republican majority built its impeachment  case against Clinton. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking  Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, assailed the four articles of  impeachment, count by count, as unfounded by evidence and failing  to rise to impeachment. </s> <s>  He saved his most savage scorn for the final  count, abuse of power. </s> <s>  The majority has simply tried to dress up  the perjury counts in the Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers  said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> House moves to impeach Clinton for perjury and demands his resignation. </s> </p> </d>
