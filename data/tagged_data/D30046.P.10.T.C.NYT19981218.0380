article= <d> <p> <s>  Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public  role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President  Clinton. </s> <s>  His previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month  since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating  in his public career: He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural  wrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he ended it by telling  his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during  his 20-year tenure in Congress. </s> <s>  His disclosure followed an investigation  by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday  at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif. </s> <s> , that his publication  had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the  last 10 years. </s> <s>  Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose  the hypocrisy of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton  and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had  had affairs with members of Congress. </s> <s>  He said Friday that this larger  investigation, to be published perhaps as soon as January, would reveal  what he described as indiscretions of several other Republicans. </s> <s>  He  said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired  an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees  of the FBI and the CIA. </s> <s>  He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry  Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc. </s> <s> , which has done work for the president's  private lawyers. </s> <s>  Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday. </s> <s>  He  spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of  the House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach  Clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions. </s> <s>  Several colleagues  knelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the  back. </s> <s>  He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber,  avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between  the House and his regular office across the street. </s> <s>  The only word  out of his aides was that the Navy had awarded contracts worth millions  of dollars for ships to be built in his Louisiana district at the  Avondale Shipyards. </s> <s>  During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats  made only oblique allusions to human failures. </s> <s>  For example, Rep. </s> <s>  John  Lewis, D-Ga. </s> <s> , said: Let he that has no sin cast the first stone. </s> <s>   Who, who among us has not sinned? </s> <s>  But no one said that Livingston's  disclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence  their votes on impeachment. </s> <s>  Rather, on the House floor and in hallway  chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either  Republicans or Democrats wanted to talk about. </s> <s>  Bob Livingston is  a first-rate human being, said Rep. </s> <s>  David Obey, D-Wis. </s> <s> , who has  worked closely and sparred with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee,  in an interview. </s> <s>  I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St. James  a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking  after our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's. </s> <s>   None of us have any business even having an opinion on it. </s> <s>  Even  conservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure. </s> <s>   We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated  your vows with your wife,' said Rep. </s> <s>  Lindsey Graham, R-S. </s> <s> C. </s> <s>  Like  many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct  from Clinton's by saying that the president had trampled on the  legal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private. </s> <s>  Despite  Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed the Clinton administration  for smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. </s> <s>  This  isn't just happening on its own, said Rep. </s> <s>  Dana Rohrabacher, R-  Calif. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Livingston's admission of adultery draws mild reaction from colleagues. </s> </p> </d>
