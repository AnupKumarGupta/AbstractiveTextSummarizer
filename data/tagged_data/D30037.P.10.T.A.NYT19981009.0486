article= <d> <p> <s>  The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. </s> <s>  10: Just  days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations  with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted  the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon  as Israeli foreign minister. </s> <s>  The most optimistic reading is that Sharon,  long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace  with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed. </s> <s>  Unfortunately,  he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort. </s> <s>  Much will  depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a  goal that has eluded other Israeli leaders. </s> <s>  Like a political typhoon,  Sharon has roared across Israeli life for better than three decades  as a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister and  an ardent conservative, often leaving destruction in his wake. </s> <s>  He  still bears the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of  Palestinians by Christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982. </s> <s>  An Israeli  inquiry found he was indirectly responsible for the killings at the  Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. </s> <s>  As a leader of the most conservative  wing of the Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his  shaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser  Arafat, the Palestinian leader. </s> <s>  That will be fine if Sharon is willing  to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself. </s> <s>  But such behavior  is not likely to be the first impulse of a man who has famously said  he would never shake hands with Arafat. </s> <s>  Since Netanyahu has designated  Sharon as his chief negotiator, the new foreign minister will soon  have the opportunity to act more responsibly. </s> <s>  The first order of business  when the two sides get together next week outside Washington is to  wrap up negotiations over the further withdrawal of Israeli forces  from the West Bank coupled with security guarantees from the Palestinians. </s> <s>   Sharon can show statesmanship by helping Netanyahu close this deal,  even though it is opposed by the Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon  has long championed. </s> <s>  Success in these talks would clear the way for  the last and most difficult negotiations about a permanent settlement,  including the shape and status of a Palestinian state and the future  of Jerusalem. </s> <s>  If Sharon ever hopes to overcome the shame of Sabra  and Shatila, he must become a force for peace in the Middle East. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Israeli Foreign Minister Sharon can make or break peace effort. </s> </p> </d>
