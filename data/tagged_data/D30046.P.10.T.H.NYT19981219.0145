article= <d> <p> <s>  In the end, the will of the people meant nothing. </s> <s>  Bob Livingston couldn't  have been clearer about that. </s> <s>  His mind and the minds of his followers  were closed. </s> <s>  Even as the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from  coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even  as his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque  invasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient  pursuit of the president, even as the country began to contemplate  the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the  speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard  the outside influences. </s> <s>  The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing  but the echoes of their own fanaticism. </s> <s>  Impeach! </s> <s>  Impeach! </s> <s>  And that  continued even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that  Livingston would quit the House. </s> <s>  Dismayed by the partisan stampede,  Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, warned during the impeachment  debate on Friday: In your effort to uphold the Constitution, you  are trampling the Constitution. </s> <s>  David Bonior, the Democratic whip,  said: This is wrong. </s> <s>  It is unfair. </s> <s>  It is unjust. </s> <s>  At a time when  events in the world and the challenges at home demand that we stand  united, censure is the one solution that can bring us together. </s> <s>  To  my colleagues across the aisle, I say let go of your obsession. </s> <s>  Listen  to the American people. </s> <s>  But the voices of reason would not be heard. </s> <s>   Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry  Hydes, the Bob Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not  be denied. </s> <s>  Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. </s> <s>  They  could protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. </s> <s>  It didn't matter. </s> <s>   The right was on the march and democracy was on the run. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Thomas  Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind his Republican  colleagues that the Constitution does not allow you to remove a  president from office because you can't stand him. </s> <s>  He was, of course,  ignored. </s> <s>  The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly  partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance  of the will of the people. </s> <s>  The party's contempt for the voters was  arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan Simpson, the former  senator from Wyoming, who said: The attention span of Americans  is which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly  report on their stock will change. </s> <s>  If the voters are the dopes that  Mr. Simpson thinks they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten  there was an impeachment crisis. </s> <s>  But Rep. </s> <s>  Robert Menendez, D-N. </s> <s> J. </s> <s> ,  was probably closer to the truth when he said, I warn my colleagues  that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds  you sow today. </s> <s>  One of the many strange events of the past couple  of weeks was the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided  Republicans, the so-called moderates, surrendered their independence  and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing's lead. </s> <s>  All proclaimed  loudly that they were voting on principle, but in fact it was an exercise  in mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep. </s> <s>  John McHugh of upstate New  York. </s> <s>  McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment. </s> <s>   But if his decision was based on principle, he had an odd way of expressing  it. </s> <s>  The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no stomach for  a Senate conviction or removal of the president from office. </s> <s>  Of his  colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, I, for one, would accept,  even welcome, their mercy. </s> <s>  In other words, let the Senate do the  heavy constitutional lifting. </s> <s>  McHugh may have wished out loud for  mercy, but he clearly was too frightened of the right-wingers in the  House to cast a compassionate vote himself. </s> <s>  The GOP can no longer  conceal that it is a party of extremists, of right-wing absolutists,  a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of  most Americans. </s> <s>  Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment  can still serve as his party's slogan. </s> <s>  Let us disregard the outside  influences. </s> <s>  Let us disregard the people. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Bob Livingston proclaims, "Let us disregard the outside influences.". </s> </p> </d>
