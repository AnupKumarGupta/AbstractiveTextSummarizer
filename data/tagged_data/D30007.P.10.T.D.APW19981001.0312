Majera. </s> <s>  Majera  said the attackers were believed to be rebels of the Allied Democratic  Forces who operate from bases in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains  that straddle the Uganda-Congolese border. </s> <s>  He said the rebels likely  fled back to their bases after the attack. </s> <s>  Majera said the attackers  avoided a nearby army post when they shot up the village. </s> <s>  It was the  gunfire that alerted the soldiers, he said, adding that they killed  two of the assailants. </s> <s>  The various rebel groups operating in the region  often attack with knives or machetes, either to save on ammunition  or because they don't have guns. </s> <s>  He had no further details. </s> <s>  Under  an agreement earlier this year with Congo, Uganda sent troops into  the neighboring country to flush out the ADF fighters. </s> <s>  President Yoweri  Museveni insists they will remain there until Ugandan security is  guaranteed, despite Congolese President Laurent Kabila's protests  that Uganda is backing Congolese rebels attempting to topple him. </s> <s>   The anti-Kabila rebels claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army,  which operates in northern Uganda and enjoys support from Sudan, is  fighting alongside Kabila's forces together with Sudanese soldiers. </s> <s>   The government-owned daily New Vision reported Thursday that LRA leader  Joseph Kony was badly wounded last week and is in hospital in Juba,  the largest town still under government control in southern Sudan. </s> <s>   The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is fighting the government  in Khartoum for autonomy for southern Sudan, has waged pitched battles  with government troops in the past week as it moves on Juba, spokesmen  for both sides say. </s> <s>  New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for  Security Muruli Mukasa as saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain,  38 kilometers (24 miles) south of Juba, was destroyed last week when  the SPLA took control. </s> <s>  Muruli said the LRA had been planning to bomb  several sites in the Ugandan capital, including the Parliament building,  state-run Radio Uganda, unidentified embassies and other public sites,  the newspaper said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Rebels kill 6 civilians in Congolese village; Ugandan troops aid rebels. </s> </p> </d>
