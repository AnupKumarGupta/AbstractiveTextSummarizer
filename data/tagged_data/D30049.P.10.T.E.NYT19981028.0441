article= <d> <p> <s>  North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. </s> <s>  delegation next month to  discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground  complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program,  the State Department said on Wednesday. </s> <s>  The delegation, led by Charles  Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence  agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a  frozen nuclear arms program. </s> <s>  We've made clear to the North Koreans  that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development  program would be unacceptable, the State Department spokesman, James  Rubin, said. </s> <s>  The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, are  aimed at completely satisfying U.S. </s> <s>  concerns about the suspect construction. </s> <s>   American intelligence agencies fear that building the complex could  be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea  pledged to give up its nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billions  of dollars in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. </s> <s>  American  officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands  of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon,  the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled  enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. </s> <s>   Although they have not explained exactly why the government is building  the complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used  to develop nuclear weapons. </s> <s>  The official North Korean press agency  said last week that the government was building civilian underground  structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast and suggested that  American officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they  pressed for access. </s> <s>  If the U.S. </s> <s>  side persists in inspecting our  underground structures, the press agency said, we can show it  to them. </s> <s>  Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurances  that Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues,  and his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the trip,  which is to begin on Nov. </s> <s>  16. </s> <s>  We are beginning a discussion with  them in which we will demand access, Rubin said. </s> <s>  The history of  the U.S. </s> <s> -North Korea discussions involves usually a lengthy discussion  process before there is agreement to our requirements. </s> <s>  So we are not  expecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next. </s> <s>   The trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of relations  between the United States and North Korea. </s> <s>  Representatives of the  United States, China and the two Koreas met recently in Geneva and  agreed to steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. </s> <s>  In September  the United States pledged to provide an additional 300,000 tons of  grain to North Korea, which has for years been crippled by severe  food shortages. </s> <s>  In addition the White House disclosed that the United  States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under  the 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to  revive its nuclear program. </s> <s>  American officials have said the activity  near Yongbyon may not yet have technically violated the accord, because  there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for  a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to  bomb-grade plutonium. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> U.S. </s> <s>  delegation to visit North Korea to discuss suspect underground complex. </s> </p> </d>
