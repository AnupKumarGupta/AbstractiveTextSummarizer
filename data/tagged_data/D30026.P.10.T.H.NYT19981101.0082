article= <d> <p> <s>  The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off,  but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial. </s> <s>   The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp. </s> <s> 's defense, to a striking  degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. </s> <s>  The human  testimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence. </s> <s>  On the stand or  in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble  and forget. </s> <s>  The e-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated  with profanity and exclamation points. </s> <s>  The second week of the trial  ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination  by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show  several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft  chairman. </s> <s>  With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc. </s> <s> ,  taking the stand Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will  be played. </s> <s>  The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft  believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows  Gates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government  alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software  market. </s> <s>  The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's  trial lawyer, offers an opportunity to judge Gates' credibility. </s> <s>   But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue not  because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compared  and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received. </s> <s>  The e-mail record,  the government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive  deals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes to have never  heard of in his taped deposition. </s> <s>  If his machinations are central  to the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial? </s> <s>  The  government does not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have  his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states,  told the court. </s> <s>  The Microsoft legal team has for months been preparing  its e-mail defense. </s> <s>  First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks damaging  is taken out of context. </s> <s>  I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's  lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to view with considerable  skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the  core of the government's case. </s> <s>  But Microsoft has also mounted an  e-mail counterattack, culled from the millions of messages it obtained  by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery. </s> <s>  Warden's cross-examination  ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail  from his company and then pose a declaration as a question. </s> <s>  These  interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does  exactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true  that Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist  but because of its superior technology? </s> <s>  Microsoft is accused of trying  to prod companies to stay out of its way. </s> <s>  So last week, for example,  Warden produced e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America  Online, suggesting a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. </s> <s>   in which both companies would focus on their respective strengths. </s> <s>   That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve  the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in  an earlier e-mail as beating the Beast From Redmond that wants to  see us both dead _ a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond,  Wash. </s> <s>  Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication. </s> <s>   By the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed memoranda started  to be used in court cases. </s> <s>  From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal  experts say, there was an explosion of documentation fueled by the  new technologies of electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines,  and then personal computers. </s> <s>  And e-mail, they add, has played an important  role in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the  1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial. </s> <s>   But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust  investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted  the telephone as the most common instrument of communication. </s> <s>  E-mail  has just revolutionized investigations of this kind, one senior  Justice Department official said. </s> <s>  While under investigation, Microsoft  has handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents,  mostly e-mail. </s> <s>  In the trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000  exhibits, mainly e-mail. </s> <s>  And in their e-mail, people often communicate  more frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report  _ tap it out, punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace. </s> <s>  But e-mail  communication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases provides  a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning  at the time. </s> <s>  It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony,  so often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory. </s> <s>  The  e-mail record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response  harder to sustain, said Robert Litan, a former senior official in  the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings  Institution. </s> <s>  It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions  in testimony. </s> <s>  And that is what the government will do in attacking  Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three  days in August. </s> <s>  The government offered a glimpse of that strategy  on the first day of the trial. </s> <s>  It showed a few brief clips of a point  in the deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21,  1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide  the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the  company, which is its chief rival in that market. </s> <s>  In the taped deposition,  Gates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether  he thought it made sense to invest in Netscape. </s> <s>  He said that he was  asked about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't  see that as something that made sense. </s> <s>  But in an e-mail on May 31,  1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape. </s> <s>  We could even pay them  money as part of the deal, he wrote, buying a piece of them or  something. </s> <s>  The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail,  though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft  made an illegal offer to Netscape. </s> <s>  To be sure, it is what Microsoft  did _ not what it said in e-mail communications _ that counts most. </s> <s>   But once the e-mail that looks bad gets in the record, you end up  doing what Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial  doing _ trying to explain it away, said Stephen Axinn, a leading  antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider in  New York. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Microsoft Antitrust Case -- The First Major E-Mail Trial. </s> </p> </d>
