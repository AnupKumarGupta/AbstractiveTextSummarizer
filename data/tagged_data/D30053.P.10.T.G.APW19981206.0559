article= <d> <p> <s>  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat  of making a farce of the Wye River accords and said he would not  agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. </s> <s>   Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians  were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood  because they believed they had the Clinton administration in their  back pocket. </s> <s>  The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye  River accord. </s> <s>  They think they have the United States in their back  pocket, said the Israeli leader. </s> <s>  As long as that is the case,  they will not change their behavior. </s> <s>  Netanyahu said he did not believe  the United States was siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply  worded remarks sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill  Clinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior to his  Dec. </s> <s>  12-15 trip. </s> <s>  Palestinians claim it is Israel that has violated  the summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political  activists, by confiscating West Bank land for roads and allowing Jewish  settlers to seize hilltops for expansion. </s> <s>  Ahmed Qureia, speaker of  the Palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team  that negotiated the Oslo accords, told reporters Sunday all means  of resistance was justified in opposing settler activity. </s> <s>  Netanyahu,  who rejected claims of settlement expansion as bunk, was interviewed  in the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government,  which rallied behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. </s> <s>  But officials  said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous  to the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to  Gaza and the West Bank. </s> <s>  We are not going to give up territory when  there are violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that  weren't achieved at Wye using violence, Netanyahu said. </s> <s>  Israel has  threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled  for Dec. </s> <s>  18, three days after Clinton's departure. </s> <s>  The United States  has said it should go ahead as scheduled. </s> <s>  Palestinians see the Clinton  trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even  though Clinton has specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's  Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. </s> <s>  Netanyahu  made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed at the  newly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides said would be  viewed as a strong symbol of support for Palestinian demands for sovereignty. </s> <s>   We will be very disappointed if that is the case. </s> <s>  We've said to  the United States that we don't think that is necessary, Netanyahu  said of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. </s> <s>  He said traveling  by motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. </s> <s>  Unless  somebody wants to put a thumb in our eye, I think there are better  ways to travel, Netanyahu said. </s> <s>  In the interview, Netanyahu stressed  that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop  threatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians  maintain the Oslo accords expire. </s> <s>  What must be is that Yasser Arafat  retracts this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River  accords and recommits himself to negotiating until we get white smoke,  until we get a solution. </s> <s>  That's the only way we'll get a real peace  between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu said. </s> <s>  In a conciliatory  speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought  a negotiated settlement and did not mention May 4 as a deadline. </s> <s>  He  also said any Palestinian state would not make alliances with states  hostile to Israel _ one of Netanyahu's key concerns. </s> <s>  The Israeli leader  is also demanding that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promised  at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks  that resulted in bloodshed, rather than freeing car thieves and petty  criminals. </s> <s>  Each side has a different interpretation of the understanding  regarding the prisoners. </s> <s>  Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free  those with blood on their hands. </s> <s>  It's high time that Yasser  Arafat admits this was agreed upon and that he's not going to make  demands on Israel, including the incitement of violence,. </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s> on a trumped-up  charge,  he said. </s> <s>  Israel never promised to release murders at  Wye, and it won't release them. </s> <s>  The issue has been the focal point  for a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West  Bank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian  inmates. </s> <s>  Israel is also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member  Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-Israel  clauses in the Palestinian charter have been deleted. </s> <s>  Netanyahu maintained  that only 25 members out of hundreds who live abroad had been invited  so far. </s> <s>  Netanyahu quoted Clinton as telling him that the purpose of  his visit was to personally make sure that they actually rescind  this charter that calls for Israel's destruction. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Israeli-Palestinian
