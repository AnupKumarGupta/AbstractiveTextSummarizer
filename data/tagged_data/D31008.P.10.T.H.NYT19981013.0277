article= <d> <p> <s>  On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard,  a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung  up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo. </s> <s> ,  the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington. </s> <s>   It was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right,  with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to  demonize gay people for political gain in this election year. </s> <s>  This  particular press conference was to announce a new barrage of ads _  a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign _ in which alleged former  homosexuals who have changed implore others to do likewise through  the power of Jesus Christ. </s> <s>  The commercials, gooey in style, end  with a slogan: It's not about hate . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  It's about hope. </s> <s>  But it's  really about stirring up the fear that produces hate. </s> <s>  If these ads  were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant  cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't  be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three  weeks before Election Day. </s> <s>  The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating  of hope, ooze malice. </s> <s>  In one of them, homosexuality is linked  to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly  posit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure. </s> <s>  Matthew  Shepard has now been cured, that's for sure. </s> <s>  As his uncle, R.W. </s> <s>   Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to  a career in diplomacy and human rights, was a small person with  a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him. </s> <s>   Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's like something you  might see in war. </s> <s>  And a war it is. </s> <s>  Go to the Family Research Council's  Web site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to  wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain  the traditional meaning of `family. </s> <s> ' The head of the Family Research  Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential  candidate, who disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization  hates no one and deplores violence. </s> <s>  But if you wage a well-financed  media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual  orientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and un-American  seekers of special rights, ground war will follow. </s> <s>  It's a story  as old as history. </s> <s>  Once any group is successfully scapegoated as a  subhuman threat to normal values by a propaganda machine, emboldened  thugs take over. </s> <s>  Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to  his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about  an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where  a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting  discriminatory treatment by their own party. </s> <s>  The gay-bashers had been  directly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians:  Sen. </s> <s>  James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee  to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on  TV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its Gay Days;  the Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan. </s> <s>   Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent  Lott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay  people as sinful and sick. </s> <s>  A frightened gay Texas Republican who had  been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: Do  you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck  to stop this? </s> <s>  Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved  Lott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares  take on its religious wing and its crusade against people like  Matthew Shepard. </s> <s>  In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free  crusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the bad  choice of being gay. </s> <s>  Is it that mother who speaks for American values,  or is it Matthew's? </s> <s>  Go home, give your kids a hug, Judy Shepard  said in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced  her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let a day go by  without telling them you love them. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Family Research Council, Republican, gay, scapegoated as a subhuman. </s> </p> </d>
