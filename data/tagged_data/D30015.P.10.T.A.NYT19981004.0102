article= <d> <p> <s>  Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian  separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia  has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may  well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats  say. </s> <s>  Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the  scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace  in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations  prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention. </s> <s>   Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched  its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission  to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade. </s> <s>  As he has so often,  Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of  time and yet still accomplished what he wanted. </s> <s>  This weekend, foreign  diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a military stand-down  had taken place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have waged  a fierce offensive against Albanian rebels. </s> <s>  The observers said that  except for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav  army were home. </s> <s>  The daily reports of the observer mission, made  up of U.S. </s> <s> , European Union and Russian military experts, are one of  the key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide  whether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire. </s> <s>  By putting  the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo  and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic  may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said. </s> <s>   But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the  other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo  Liberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo  and its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian  population that supports it. </s> <s>  His military operation created more than  250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to  take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations. </s> <s>   U.S. </s> <s>  officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. </s> <s>  envoy  who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia,  to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo. </s> <s>   The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's  principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province,  and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression  since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who  now seek independence. </s> <s>  The West, fearing the precedent that independence  for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying  to mediate a middle course. </s> <s>  In essence, diplomats said they believed  that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year  interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy  arrangement. </s> <s>  Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics  of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able  to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population  into submission with impunity. </s> <s>  The United States and its allies  have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation  Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group,  a policy analysis organization, and taken three weeks to discuss  military action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed. </s> <s>   Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to  live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic  took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery  and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose  bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of  large swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads. </s> <s>  While he was  doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington:  he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania  and Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area. </s> <s>   All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo  conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania  and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause. </s> <s>   Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just  three years after peace was secured in Bosnia. </s> <s>  Milosevic catered to  Washington's concern that the conflict be contained. </s> <s>  The Yugoslav  army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that  few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for  the rebels. </s> <s>  The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was  unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political  leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose  main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany. </s> <s>   For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim  Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter  that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity. </s> <s>  For that  procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban  on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month  before. </s> <s>  After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military  operations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and  carry out the investment ban. </s> <s>  In late June, Holbrooke met with two  self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western  town of Junik but then broke off all contact. </s> <s>  Clinton administration  officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention  would bolster the separatist forces. </s> <s>  To try to put the best face on  the situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept  the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and  report on military action. </s> <s>  The monitors were slow in getting organized. </s> <s>   By August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police,  were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages  in the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to  the fighting. </s> <s>  They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going  on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise. </s> <s>  In recent  days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved,  the monitors say. </s> <s>  But there are some areas in central Kosovo around  Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits  because of land mines on the roads. </s> <s>  The mines are believed to have  been planted by the guerrillas. </s> <s>  Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre  of 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept. </s> <s>   26. </s> <s>  A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on  Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police  or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon. </s> <s>   The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the  vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a report  by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday. </s> <s>   The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking  civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. </s> <s>  But the violations  by the guerrillas were on a lesser scale than the government abuses,  the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. </s> <s>  The report focused  on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police  forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early  March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. </s> <s>  At least 83 people,  including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which  involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. </s> <s>  In  the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through  rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains  politically secure. </s> <s>  That is in part, his domestic critics say, because  diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N. </s> <s> refugee agency, Sadako  Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Yugoslav military ordered back to barracks as NATO again threatens. </s> </p> </d>
