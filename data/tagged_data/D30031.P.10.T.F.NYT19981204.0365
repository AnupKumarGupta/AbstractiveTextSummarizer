article= <d> <p> <s>  The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle  Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S. </s> <s> -built  part of an international space station that is expected to cost more  than $100 billion. </s> <s>  After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced  a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36  Friday morning, right on schedule. </s> <s>  The night sky was clear, and the  moon full. </s> <s>  With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly  turned the Florida coastline from night to day. </s> <s>  More than five minutes  and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen  in the distance, twinkling like a new star. </s> <s>  On their 12-day flight,  Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit,  grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. </s> <s>  module. </s> <s>   Wielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically  in the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly  that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great  cathedrals look like child's play. </s> <s>  Construction of the station, which  will be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walks,  which, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. </s> <s>  When  complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power  arrays, will cover an area equal to that of two football fields. </s> <s>  Modules  of interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven  astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. </s> <s>   The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile. </s> <s>   The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty  of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space,  along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the  construction site. </s> <s>  The work is further complicated by international  politics and worries about money. </s> <s>  The Russians, whose participation  in the partnership clinched the post-Cold War deal five years ago,  are now a wild card. </s> <s>  Moscow's economic and political woes have left  Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up  with its share of money and technology. </s> <s>  At the same time, the station's  costs are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its  appetite for money will consume their own federal financing. </s> <s>  The project's  total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates  now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's  estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. </s> <s>  Of that, American taxpayers are  to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners  about $14 billion. </s> <s>  The station is intended to be a grand laboratory  where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop  new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries,  in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space  flight to other worlds. </s> <s>  Friday, in any case, little was heard about  the project but praise. </s> <s>  Great show, Endeavour, mission control  in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into  orbit. </s> <s>  At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  lauded the launching team and the new venture. </s> <s>  That was truly, truly  fantastic, she told the team after the liftoff. </s> <s>  And it was important,  she added, to have so many nations working together on the kinds  of issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with. </s> <s>  So  my congratulations to all of you, the secretary said. </s> <s>  Stupendous  work. </s> <s>  The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S. </s> <s> -built  station part. </s> <s>  Small compared with the giants to come in three dozen  shuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet long, weighs  13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules. </s> <s>  Saturday,  one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. </s> <s>  Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have  the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure  it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal  to a vertical position. </s> <s>  Then, Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous  with the module known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched  into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. </s> <s>  20. </s> <s>  Financed by the United States  but built in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is be a kind of tugboat  for the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well  as communication and rendezvous abilities. </s> <s>  When Endeavour's payload  bay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with  the robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. </s> <s>   The mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big. </s> <s>  Zarya,  while completely weightless in space, has 21 tons of mass. </s> <s>  If mishandled,  it can crush and kill. </s> <s>  As Col. </s> <s>  Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's  commander, Col. </s> <s>  Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three  space flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station  pieces together. </s> <s>  When mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity  will form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide  out to the tips of the solar arrays. </s> <s>  Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking  astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between  the units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future  visitors. </s> <s>  The builders will be Col. </s> <s>  Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50,  and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. </s> <s>  Their series of three space  walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. </s> <s>  12. </s> <s>  As construction  goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making  preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel  and docking system. </s> <s>  Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic  station for the first time, installing portable fans and lights. </s> <s>  Friday  they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next  major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia. </s> <s>  The  other astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. </s> <s>  Frederick Sturckow  of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of  the Russian Space Agency. </s> <s>  After separating from the new outpost, the  crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. </s> <s>   15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days. </s> <s>  Gretchen McClain,  NASA's director in Washington for the international space station,  said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small  for individual Americans. </s> <s>  Over its lifetime, she said, the annual  cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's  96 million taxpayers. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  costs for construction, she added, were  $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 were $10. </s> <s> 4 billion,  for a total of $34. </s> <s> 4 billion. </s> <s>  Most experts outside the agency consider  this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars  spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle  flights, which run about $800 million apiece. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Friday shuttle launch flawless. </s> <s>  Mission: attach US and Russian modules. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
