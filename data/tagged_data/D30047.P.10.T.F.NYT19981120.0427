article= <d> <p> <s>  The first piece of the international space station was orbiting Earth  Friday, sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels as it  awaited other segments, which will eventually grow into the largest  orbital laboratory in history. </s> <s>  The module, called Zarya from the Russian  term meaning sunrise or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop  a three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40  a.m. </s> <s>  Eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. </s> <s>  The  launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the  16 nations that are sponsoring the station, which will cost at least  $40 billion to build over the next five years. </s> <s>  Zarya, built in Russia  with $240 million from the United States, is to be joined in two weeks  by the first American module, a docking hub called Unity. </s> <s>  The space  shuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec. </s> <s>  3 to rendezvous with Zarya  and attach the two units. </s> <s>  This is to be followed by 43 more flights  by American and Russian rockets carrying more than 100 parts to be  assembled in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing  up to seven astronauts. </s> <s>  Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA,  said at a news conference following the launching, Now we only have  44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless  problems. </s> <s>  But because of all the partner nations trusting each other  and working together, he said, the international space station is  going to be a reality. </s> <s>  Even as the new space station is coming together,  questions continue about the fate of Russia's existing space laboratory,  the 12-year-old Mir. </s> <s>  Because of the collapse of the Russian economy,  doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment  to support both projects led Russia to promise that it would abandon  Mir and destroy the station by next summer. </s> <s>  However, in recent weeks  Russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend Mir's  life. </s> <s>  According to a report by the news agency Reuters, President  Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he  was preparing a number of proposals on extending Mir's life past the  year 2000. </s> <s>  Support for such options has been growing in recent weeks  among Russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists, who see  Mir as a symbol of Russian achievements in space. </s> <s>  James Van Laak,  NASA's deputy manager of operations for the space station, said Friday  that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending  Mir's life. </s> <s>  NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has  any measurable impact on the international space station, Van Laak  said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston,  No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the  Russians find a way to support both projects, but they have to demonstrate  they can. </s> <s>  Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said the  launching of Zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply  power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction,  was a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program. </s> <s>  The  Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to  fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station,  Koptev said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Russia looking to extend Mir's life after promise to abandon and destroy it. </s> </p> </d>
