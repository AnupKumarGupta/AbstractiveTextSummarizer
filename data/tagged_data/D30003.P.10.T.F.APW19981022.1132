article= <d> <p> <s>  A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible  extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday  that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil. </s> <s>  There is a climate  of division, confrontation and instability in Chile, parliamentary  deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean  ambassador. </s> <s>  Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. </s> <s>  16 at the instigation  of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite  the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. </s> <s>   In Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of  victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired  general's supporters. </s> <s>  Espina also warned that the issue was damaging  relations between Chile Spain and Britain. </s> <s>  Spain was the biggest single  investor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain. </s> <s>  The deputy  arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senators Jovino  Movoa and Julio Lagos. </s> <s>  The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group  of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in  London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic  Union and the National Renovation Party. </s> <s>  Espina, Movoa and Lagos were  hoping to talk to officials from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and  other government representatives. </s> <s>  All we ask is that Spain stops  meddling in our internal affairs, Espina said, arguing that Chilean  problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts. </s> <s>  We stopped being  a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of becoming  one again, he added. </s> <s>  Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime  Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the  state-owned news agency EFE reported. </s> <s>  Aznar has promised his government  will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government  if asked to do so by the judicial authorities. </s> <s>  But the extradition  attempt could be annulled by legal challenges in Spain well before  the deadline for presenting it in Britain. </s> <s>  The deadline is set for  November 25th _ coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. </s> <s>  On Thursday  the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals  against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's  detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. </s> <s>   The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an  earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human  rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest  warrant. </s> <s>  A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction  of Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult. </s> <s>  The decision  is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, as  these crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Chile near domestic turmoil over extradition. </s> <s>  Spain debates proceeding. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
