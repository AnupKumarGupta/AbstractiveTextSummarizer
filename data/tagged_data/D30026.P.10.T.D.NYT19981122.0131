article= <d> <p> <s>  America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications  Corp. </s> <s> , the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust  suit against Microsoft Corp. </s> <s> , executives involved in the talks said  Sunday. </s> <s>  The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving  AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. </s> <s>  AOL, the leading on-line service  with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular  site on the World Wide Web and its software business. </s> <s>  But as part  of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development  partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business  of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to  serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands  of users at the same time. </s> <s>  The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares  for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. </s> <s>  A completed deal  could be announced as soon as Monday morning. </s> <s>  But executives involved  in the talks cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to  be negotiated. </s> <s>  The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three  businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services,  Internet software and electronic commerce. </s> <s>  It would strengthen two  of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. </s> <s>  At the same  time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker  once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance  of the personal computer software market. </s> <s>  Netscape, founded in 1994,  has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft. </s> <s>   Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser  software used to navigate the World Wide Web. </s> <s>  But Microsoft, responding  to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly  matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the  Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows  operating system and giving it away free. </s> <s>  Earlier this year, Netscape  announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well,  as Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. </s> <s>  Since then, Netscape  has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction  fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software  to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which  to conduct electronic commerce. </s> <s>  AOL believes it has the expertise  to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's  programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's  software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said. </s> <s>   Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating  systems for the large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server  software. </s> <s>  This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of  Netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its technologies  forward, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business  school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology of a recent book, Competing on Internet  Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft. </s> <s>  The impact  of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft  is uncertain. </s> <s>  It does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's  defense _ namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where  corporate alliances shift all the time. </s> <s>  Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust  policy should tread gently. </s> <s>  But the deal, government officials insist,  should have no direct effect on the current case. </s> <s>  No matter how  much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's  monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect  its monopoly, said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial  lawyer in the Microsoft case. </s> <s>  Executives representing Netscape, AOL  and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. </s> <s>   And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer  James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago,  or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people  close to the talks. </s> <s>  Industry analysts suggest that the companies may  have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly  on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. </s> <s>   And representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, a Silicon  Valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's  rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> AOL intends to buy Netscape and develop partnership with Sun Microsystems. </s> </p> </d>
