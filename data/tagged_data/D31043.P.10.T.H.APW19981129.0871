article= <d> <p> <s>  Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from  Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political  crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war. </s> <s>   Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker  capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president,  said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new  Cabinet. </s> <s>  There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing  Hariri as prime minister. </s> <s>  Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining  tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the  apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's  economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. </s> <s>  Hariri,  53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction  program, has been in power since 1992. </s> <s>  A billionaire businessman who  made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring  economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. </s> <s>  Lahoud,  62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread  popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up  the graft-riddled administration. </s> <s>  The British-trained general made  his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. </s> <s>   Previous disputes among government leaders have cost the Central Bank  hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the Lebanese  pound. </s> <s>  Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved  only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this  country. </s> <s>  Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. </s> <s>  Lahoud had been  expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to  form the next government. </s> <s>  The decree was to be issued after the president  polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime  minister. </s> <s>  But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming  support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president  to select a prime minister. </s> <s>  The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential  decree followed. </s> <s>  The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition  of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because  he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in  selecting the premier. </s> <s>  The Hariri camp argues that the president can  poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot  accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. </s> <s>  The dispute, in fact,  appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will  be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. </s> <s>  Toward the end of former  President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had  a free hand in running the country. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Lebanon's Prime Minister Hariri Declines Invite to Select New Cabinet. </s> </p> </d>
