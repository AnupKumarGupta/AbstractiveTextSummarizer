article= <d> <p> <s>  Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer. </s> <s>  But for  more than three decades his role in Israeli public life has been that  of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in  the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics. </s> <s>  With his blunt  tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 is  to his many critics here a caricature of right-wing intransigence. </s> <s>   To his equally numerous admirers he is a living symbol of unrelenting  dedication to Israel's national survival. </s> <s>  Still conveying physical  vigor within an impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious  to a fault. </s> <s>  Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign  minister is not a natural diplomat. </s> <s>  A Zionist underground operative  as a teen-ager and an infantry commander wounded in the 1948 war of  independence, Sharon has fought, and fought memorably, in virtually  every major military engagement in his country's history. </s> <s>  He commanded  the legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of  the Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. </s> <s>  He returned to active service  after a three-month retirement to lead Israel's badly outgunned armored  divisions to victory, again in the Sinai, in the war of 1973. </s> <s>  As defense  minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying  international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on  Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the  Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. </s> <s>   To some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will  forever be associated with the massacres by Lebanese Christian Phalangists,  allies of the Israelis, of a reported 460 unarmed Palestinians in  the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. </s> <s>  In an official inquiry in Jerusalem  and in a subsequent libel trial he brought in New York, Sharon was  seen to have effectively refuted charges that he knew of and condoned  the Phalangists' attacks beforehand. </s> <s>  But the government investigating  commission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted  grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry. </s> <s>  Since the 1982  invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation  of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young  inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed. </s> <s>  To many Israelis,  however, the Lebanese incursion was ultimately a risk worth taking,  as it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving its forces  far from Israel's borders. </s> <s>  The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hands in Lebanon  led eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel  and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon as Foreign  Minister will now be responsible. </s> <s>  In civilian life he proved as savvy  a political operator as he was a military strategist, helping to break  Labor's hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding  force within successive fractious Likud coalitions. </s> <s>  His investiture  as foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment  in 21 years. </s> <s>  He previously held the agriculture and defense portfolios  under Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak  Shamir's government, and national infrastructure _ essentially, a  settlements support directorate _ in the administration of Benjamin  Netanyahu. </s> <s>  As a key member of the inner cabinet in Begin's first  government, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion  of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza  Strip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967,  a policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal  domestic political achievement. </s> <s>  At 70, Sharon remains one of the great  polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life. </s> <s>  An acerbic critic of  the other leading soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin,  Sharon attacked the Oslo peace accords as terrible and dangerous  and condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, as a war  criminal. </s> <s>  He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return  of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria. </s> <s>  A  secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born  Israelis, Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new  Orthodox Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian areas  of the West Bank, cementing his position as a bridge between the traditional  secular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud  coalition. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Sharon: an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield or in partisan politics. </s> </p> </d>
