article= <d> <p> <s>  Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock  Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun  Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. </s> <s>  In a  long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh  will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed  elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of  64 seats in the 122-member chamber. </s> <s>  Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party  dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh  and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. </s> <s>  It was one of the main  stumbling blocks in months of discord. </s> <s>  Instead, Sihanouk announced,  the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea  Sim will head. </s> <s>  Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during  the king's frequent absences from the country. </s> <s>  The major political  crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock  facing the nation has also come to an end, the king said in his  statement. </s> <s>  The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. </s> <s>  The  agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they  would be divided. </s> <s>  The parties will hammer out details later. </s> <s>  Pok Than,  one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly  advisory role to the assembly. </s> <s>  The senior Senate leaders will join  those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two  Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that  will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. </s> <s>  The two parties  said that the assembly would convene again Nov. </s> <s>  25. </s> <s>  The agreement  came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from  Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures  for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. </s> <s>   The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the  CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors  and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which  is in desperate need of aid. </s> <s>  It could also hasten Cambodia's entry  into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last  year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody  coup. </s> <s>  Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second  day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form  a coalition and made important concessions. </s> <s>  The king, the sole  force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both  sides to reach agreement before he leaves Saturday for medical treatment  in Beijing. </s> <s>  Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to  a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political  pardons. </s> <s>  All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that  are widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. </s> <s>  The king has powers to grant  pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive  cases. </s> <s>  Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been  at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections  in July. </s> <s>  The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed  last year's coup. </s> <s>  The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed  to form a government alone. </s> <s>  Ranariddh's party and opposition ally  Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud  and intimidation. </s> <s>  The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh  seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. </s> <s>  Sam Rainsy,  under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations,  has remained abroad. </s> <s>  His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant  to forming a working government. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Sihanouk says Cambodian government crisis resolved; parties to share power. </s> </p> </d>
