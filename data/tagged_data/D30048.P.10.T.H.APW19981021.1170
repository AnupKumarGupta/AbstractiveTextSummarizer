article= <d> <p> <s>  There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President  Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. </s> <s>  No haircuts  or phone calls, either. </s> <s>  Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso  wants to slash dlrs 19 billion (23. </s> <s> 5 billion reals) from the budget  deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000  workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. </s> <s>  Sure,  it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion,  or 7 percent of economic output. </s> <s>  But as Cardoso readies a package  of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians  that economy starts at home. </s> <s>  So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy  snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, a palace tradition. </s> <s>  Three barber  shops in the palace were closed, and the use of cellular phones and  copiers was restricted. </s> <s>  The price of a buffet offered employees for  lunch was raised from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8. </s> <s> 50 (7 reals to 10 reals). </s> <s>  Cardoso  himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. </s> <s>  On a trip to  a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation of just eight,  half the usual number. </s> <s>  The savings at the palace could come to nearly  dlrs 145,000 (170,000 reals) a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator  of the president's office. </s> <s>  Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy  battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the  full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. </s> <s>  It is believed to  include a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and  bank transactions. </s> <s>  The plan is part of a deal with the International  Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. </s> <s>  The  money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence  in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial  crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year. </s> <s>  Brazil already  has agreed to annual targets to sharply reduce its deficit through  the year 2001. </s> <s>  On Wednesday, newspapers published a joint statement  from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't been reached  yet. </s> <s>  Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians were less than impressed  by the palace penny-pinching. </s> <s>  The leftist Workers Party said the government  was making a big deal of insignificant savings while it failed to  cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals)  moat being built around Congress to keep protesters from easily entering  the building. </s> <s>  The Globo TV network also suggested there still was  plenty of fat to cut, citing government expenses for running shoes,  Persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intended as presents for visiting  dignitaries. </s> <s>  Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governors  to control spending. </s> <s>  But the governors, some facing runoff elections  on Sunday, are promising pay raises and public works projects that  could sink the austerity plan. </s> <s>  In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised  civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates  would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1. </s> <s> 2 billion reals). </s> <s>  Roriz hasn't explained  where the money would come from. </s> <s>  In powerful Minas Gerais state, the  government will almost certainly have to lay off workers _ the state  payroll consumes 78 percent of the budget. </s> <s>  To rein in the free-spending  habits of provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly wants to hold  local governments to bimonthly limits on spending. </s> <s>  Federal money would  automatically be cut off if spending gets out of hand. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Cardozao Cuts Palace Perks in Symbolic Deficit Cutting Gesture. </s> </p> </d>
