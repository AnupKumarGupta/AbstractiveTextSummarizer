article= <d> <p> <s>  The case of United States vs. </s> <s>  Microsoft Corp. </s> <s> , the government's most  aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing  out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court  rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to  support their opposing arguments. </s> <s>  Whatever the outcome of the trial,  scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. </s> <s>  District Court in Washington, an  almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of  bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines. </s> <s>   The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that  controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. </s> <s>  The  government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business  practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable  to the vicissitudes of a single company. </s> <s>  Microsoft asserts that the  case is intended to give the government control over which features  can be added to Windows. </s> <s>  However grand the economic stakes, the legal  dispute is narrow. </s> <s>  The government says that Microsoft's contracts  with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access  to the Internet illegally stifle competition. </s> <s>  The contracts prohibit  manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp. </s> <s> 's Navigator  browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. </s> <s>  They also prohibit them  from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites  on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. </s> <s>  Microsoft's  contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with  businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored  treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links  on the Windows desktop. </s> <s>  In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has  voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate  them at will. </s> <s>  Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because  they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet  access. </s> <s>  The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer  with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows  98 amount to tying, an illegal practice that forces customers  of one product to purchase another. </s> <s>  The contracts with manufacturers  and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they  are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but  to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems. </s> <s>  The  latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. </s> <s>  Browsers  have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software  platform on which other programs run. </s> <s>  So contracts intended to drive  browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. </s> <s>   Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department  is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and  no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary. </s> <s>   Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist  of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s,  says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact  it is ubiquitous. </s> <s>  No one, he said, would challenge the right of  manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile  or buttons to shirts. </s> <s>  His point, shared widely among economists,  is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results  in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover  development costs. </s> <s>  But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power. </s> <s>   The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing  good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. </s> <s>  Microsoft  says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes  what might be called a gross consumer benefits test _ that it  offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage  to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. </s> <s>  The Justice  Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle:  yielding net consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough  to balance possible long-term harm to competition. </s> <s>  So which test of  consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? </s> <s>  The simple answer is that  no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite  the same cases without fear of embarrassment. </s> <s>  Consider a 1985 case,  Aspen Skiing Co. vs. </s> <s>  Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. </s> <s> , and a 1951 case,  Lorain Journal Co. vs. </s> <s>  United States. </s> <s>  In the first, Aspen Skiing,  the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo. </s> <s>  _ the monopolist  _ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands,  a competitor, that gave skiers access to both companies' runs. </s> <s>  When  Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues  shriveled and the rival sued. </s> <s>  The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing  had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action  helped consumers. </s> <s>  In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper  in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised  on a new radio station. </s> <s>  Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the  exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers. </s> <s>  Indeed, in  Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business  with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department,  which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside  its own. </s> <s>  But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that  in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because  they offered no consumer benefit. </s> <s>  The courts, he argues, never pounced  on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service. </s> <s>   Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits  against hypothetical long-term harm. </s> <s>  Rule argues that Microsoft's  practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. </s> <s>  Besides, he says,  unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's  contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser  or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. </s> <s>  In truth, though,  neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product  design. </s> <s>  In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. </s> <s>  vs. </s> <s>  Hyde,  another case cited by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized  that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. </s> <s>   Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not  be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists  if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. </s> <s>  That  principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence  of Windows and Explorer requires bundling. </s> <s>  But Microsoft will point  to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard  for the government to meet when it alleges tying. </s> <s>  Microsoft will also  draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change  the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors  to attach peripheral equipment. </s> <s>  But perhaps Microsoft's best argument  is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which  the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the  basis of a balancing test. </s> <s>  The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer  clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products. </s> <s>  The Justice  Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust  law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices  that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out  competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. </s> <s>  The Justice Department  will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least  exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide  customers. </s> <s>  Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's  restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test. </s> <s>   But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped  or hurt is up for grabs. </s> <s>  A balancing test would have the courts weigh  the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet  sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus  the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers  and operating systems. </s> <s>  But a test that makes good sense in theory  can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. </s> <s>  Balancing tests  are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. </s> <s>  Thomas Campbell,  R-Calif. </s> <s> , who is a former law professor at Stanford University. </s> <s>  The  practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft  almost certain victory. </s> <s>  Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts  agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing  test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contracts. </s> <s>   Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended  to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist  to raise prices later. </s> <s>  Microsoft will have an easier time defending  itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing  its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that  its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good. </s> <s>  The  antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division  under President Reagan, is littered with contradictory, ambiguous  and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. </s> <s>  He and other legal experts agree  that if nothing else, that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for  the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the  spine of the antitrust law. </s> </p> </d>	abstract=
