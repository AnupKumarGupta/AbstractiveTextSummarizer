article= <d> <p> <s>  Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize  for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the  cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from  hardening of the arteries to impotence. </s> <s>  The prestigious prize went  to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. </s> <s>  Furchgott  is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn,  Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at  the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. </s> <s>  The citation by  the Karolinska Institute said it was a senation that the simple,  common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen  burns . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  could exert important functions in the organism. </s> <s>   Because  of the research, we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal  molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections and  as a regulator of blood pressure. </s> <s>  Signal transmission by a gas  that is produced by one cell, penetrates through membranes and regulates  the function of another cell represents an entirely new principle,  the citation said. </s> <s>  Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signals  has sparked research on a wide range of new drugs, including those  that can be used in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis,  shock and impotence. </s> <s>  The prize amount of 7. </s> <s> 6 million kronor (dlrs  978,000) is divided equally among the three. </s> <s>  Last year, the prize  went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San  Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identified  as causing Mad Cow Disease. </s> <s>  Winners generally aren't known outside  the medical community, although the list of laureates contains a few  familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert  Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. </s> <s>  Generally,  they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on  paper but carry large consequences. </s> <s>  Among other well-known names to  receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize  in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS  researchers. </s> <s>  Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield  may not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979  is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or  CAT scan. </s> <s>  The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be  announced this year. </s> <s>  Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese  novelist Jose Saramago. </s> <s>  The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced  Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. </s> <s>   All the announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize  which is given in Oslo, Norway. </s> <s>  The prizes are presented on Dec. </s> <s>  10,  the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and  inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Nobel Medicine Prize goes to three researchers on role of nitric oxide. </s> </p> </d>
