article= <d> <p> <s>  The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest  independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic  administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators. </s> <s>   But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated  public policy. </s> <s>  Nor, by all accounts, of politics. </s> <s>  Instead, like the  software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has  taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled  or predicted back when it started in 1989. </s> <s>  It was in November of that  year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las  Vegas, Nev. </s> <s> , that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd  been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM  _ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry. </s> <s>   The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers  and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating  on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. </s> <s>   But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows. </s> <s>   The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system  was going to become the new standard? </s> <s>  With Gates standing uncomfortably  at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that  the two companies wanted to clear the air. </s> <s>  OS/2 was the future,  he said. </s> <s>  As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product  for under-equipped computers. </s> <s>  Windows, he asserted, would never receive  all the advanced features of OS/2. </s> <s>  Gates certainly did not look happy. </s> <s>   But he did not disagree. </s> <s>  The news conference got little attention,  just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. </s> <s>   But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer  with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles,  in Byte magazine. </s> <s>  IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified  vision of graphical operating environments, the article said, and  it looks sort of like a U.S. </s> <s>  economic model, divided into lower-,  middle- and upper-class products. </s> <s>  As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft  were colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential  violation of antitrust law. </s> <s>  Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation  of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has  been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators  for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month  after month, year after year, for the last nine years. </s> <s>  Now comes the  antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity  of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different  investigative inquiries during that nine-year span. </s> <s>  Microsoft, today  the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market  value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust  target. </s> <s>  Yet, while the company's allies ask, What is the Clinton  administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft? </s> <s>  the  answer seems to be there is none. </s> <s>  In interviews, more than a dozen  current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of  the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's  antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. </s> <s>   As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division  operates independent of the administration's political considerations. </s> <s>   Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust  division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington  lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. </s> <s>  When  I was there, Rule said of his Justice days, the White House was  punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided  to do. </s> <s>  There was no communication between antitrust and other branches  of government. </s> <s>  Asked if he believed that policy had changed under  the Clinton administration, he said: Not really. </s> <s>  I've seen nothing  to suggest it. </s> <s>  Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and  in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's  technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case,  he said: There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter,  civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without  any political contact. </s> <s>  Klein said, by way of examples, that he might  discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with  the Defense Department or Transportation Department. </s> <s>  But never the  White House, he said. </s> <s>  For a significant case, we might call the  White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press  conference. </s> <s> '  The last time there was any interference, he added,  was the Dita Beard-ITT case. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp. </s> <s> ,  was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000  donation to the Republican National Convention had gone a long way  toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the  Nixon administration's Justice Department. </s> <s>  The authenticity of the  memo was never proved, and Mrs. </s> <s>  Beard always denied writing it. </s> <s>  In  any case, Klein says, since Watergate, it's been immaculate. </s> <s>  In  the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President  Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. </s> <s>  In answer to a question during  a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton  said: I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters  within the Justice Department. </s> <s>  At this time, I do not think I should  depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will  have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. </s> <s>  But I have  to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way  the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter. </s> <s>   Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly  at least. </s> <s>  And Gore, who generally represents the administration on  technology issues, has never commented at all. </s> <s>  In Rule's opinion,  the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it  were politically acceptable to do so. </s> <s>  It would be a little odd for  the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,  he said. </s> <s>  It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. </s> <s>  I  would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that. </s> <s>  Taking  sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly  since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political  donations and support. </s> <s>  In fact, the present and former government  officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the  inquiries conducted during the last nine years. </s> <s>  They began at the  FTC. </s> <s>  Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff  opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. </s> <s>  But as has happened  so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial  inquiry irrelevant. </s> <s>  Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and  Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained  a cipher. </s> <s>  But as that issue faded, once government investigators began  looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them. </s> <s>  In  1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that  the investigation was being expanded. </s> <s>  The agency, his letter said,  was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant  position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other  areas. </s> <s>  That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit. </s> <s>  One  former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence  in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had  to approve any suit, might have a different view. </s> <s>  We knew the commission  might have difficulty with a monopolization case, the former official  said. </s> <s>  They hadn't brought a case in years. </s> <s>  And in fact, in 1993  the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal  charges. </s> <s>  The deadlock served as a dismissal. </s> <s>  Then, a few months later,  the Justice Department decided to pick up the case. </s> <s>  It was farther  along than most cases we got, recalled Robert Litan, a former senior  official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now  at the Brookings Institution. </s> <s>  Usually a case would be two or three  people complaining and a few documents, he said. </s> <s>  But this was  a fully researched record. </s> <s>  They gave us the files and briefed us on  what they had done. </s> <s>  The Justice Department lawyers picked up the  same thread. </s> <s>  The general idea behind our inquiry, Litan said,  was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating  systems to cement a monopoly in other areas. </s> <s>  In 1995, Microsoft  and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company  promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft  operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every  computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. </s> <s>   The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product  to the sale of another. </s> <s>  The charges in the present suit are similar  in many ways. </s> <s>  Even with the agreement, the government investigations  continued. </s> <s>  That same year, Justice Department investigators showed  up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. </s> <s>  for the first time  to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. </s> <s>  America Online  had been complaining, a senior Netscape executive recalled, because  Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network, a competing online  service, with Windows. </s> <s>  Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. </s> <s>   The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America  Online prospered and grew. </s> <s>  But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled  the void. </s> <s>  In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general  who headed the antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints about  Microsoft all the time. </s> <s>  We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints  center. </s> <s>  And we take them very seriously. </s> <s>  In 1996, Netscape's first  complaint arrived. </s> <s>  In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape  said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating  systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's  browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed  by Netscape. </s> <s>  The next year the Justice Department formally charged  Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows  to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. </s> <s>  It  seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree, a natural  extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department  by then. </s> <s>  A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court  panel overturned that ruling this summer. </s> <s>  In the meantime, last May  the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their  new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. </s> <s>   It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other  predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations  and investigations of the last nine years. </s> <s>  A good part of this case  is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I, in the early  in the 1990s, Litan said. </s> <s>  Or, as the former senior FTC official put  it, there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through  here. </s> <s>  But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled  and spun by hundreds of different hands. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Microsoft case outgrowth of investigations and
