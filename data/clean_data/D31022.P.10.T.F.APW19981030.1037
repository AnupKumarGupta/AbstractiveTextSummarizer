59 bodies were  found at the scene and one other died later. </s> <s>  Of the injured, at least  57 were in intensive care, according to Sven Martinell, spokesman  for the local medical authorities. </s> <s>  The building did not have sprinklers  and was not required to have them, officials said. </s> <s>  The dance was attended  mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants. </s> <s>  Police said the dead  or injured represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis,  Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, along with people from current  and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries. </s> <s>  The  Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building, had in  turn rented the facility out to others for the dance, Carlsson said. </s> <s>   That person was not immdiately identified. </s> <s>  Binan Atta was walking  to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. </s> <s>  He said he raced  in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend. </s> <s>  His  clothes had burned off. </s> <s>  His skin was red and bubbly, Atta said. </s> <s>   Lots of kids were just screaming, he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran  Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. </s> <s>   I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. </s> <s>  They didn't even  look down beforehand. </s> <s>  Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. </s> <s>   (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes  later, rescue workers said. </s> <s>  The blaze was already consuming the building. </s> <s>   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire,  city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by the  Swedish news agency TT. </s> <s>  It was a panic, Goteborg police spokesman  Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and  other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. </s> <s>   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been set. </s> <s>   The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal  fire, he said. </s> <s>  Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest  of the capital, Stockholm. </s> <s>  The crowd in the second story of the building  contained mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday  weekend. </s> <s>  A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave  from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally  and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,  the Goteborg city council said in a statement. </s> <s>  Goteborg is today  a city in shock. </s> <s>  Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire  site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. </s> <s>   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the  blaze started with about 400 people inside. </s> <s>  It looked like it started  in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor, he  was quoted as saying. </s> <s>  It was chaos. </s> <s>  Everybody was trying to get  out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. </s> <s>  . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>   Others kicked out the windows and jumped out. </s> <s>  Ambulances were called  in from several nearby communities. </s> <s>  The Goteborg rescue services also  brought city buses into service to help transport the injured. </s> <s>  Anna-Lisa  Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims  were taken, said identifying many of them was difficult. </s> <s>  Maybe you  have teen-agers yourself and know how they are . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  They maybe don't  have their own identification, but have that of a friend who is a  year older. </s> <s>  Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in  a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body, she said, according  to TT. </s> <s>  Goteborg has about 435,000 people. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Fire kills 60 at 2nd floor dance hall in Sweden. </s> <s>  1 exit blocked by fire. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
