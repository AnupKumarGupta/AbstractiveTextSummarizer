article= <d> <p> <s>  Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal  spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for  the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided  aid to farmers. </s> <s>  However, no one can vote on the package just yet,  because it is not finished. </s> <s>  The deal that President Clinton and Republican  leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement  on the final portion of the $1. </s> <s> 7 trillion budget, not a written document. </s> <s>   That is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees  and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that  needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more  than 3,000 pages. </s> <s>  For example, still unresolved is a dispute over  whether airlines can create a peanut-free zone to protect passengers  who are allergic to peanuts. </s> <s>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other  members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting  the proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three  rows of someone with an allergy. </s> <s>  Congress gave itself until midnight  Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton  to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government  open. </s> <s>  The budget was due Oct. </s> <s>  1, the start of the new fiscal year. </s> <s>   The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near  to being written. </s> <s>  Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including  Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief  of staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. </s> <s>  Excluded  were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees,  who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. </s> <s>  Almost  everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with  the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the  $20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies  and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. </s> <s>  The  lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives  nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further  expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. </s> <s>  And some worry  that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly  revealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. </s> <s>   The elections are Nov. </s> <s>  3. </s> <s>  But several conservatives said that despite  these problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Mark  Souder, R-Ind. </s> <s> , said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist  conservatives, are split about 50-50. </s> <s>  If tax cuts were your primary  thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. </s> <s>   My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. </s> <s>  We have no tax cuts and  far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. </s> <s>   Every member has a little different focus. </s> <s>  Souder said he liked  the extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports  for farmers. </s> <s>  Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers  were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets. </s> <s>   Several Republicans said that the bill seemed skewed in favor of the  Democrats. </s> <s>  They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with  Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach him, and  Republican leaders feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they  might have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. </s> <s>   Clinton was buying votes, said Rep. </s> <s>  David Hobson, R-Ohio. </s> <s>  He  was sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support him  in impeachment. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  W.J. </s> <s>  (Billy) Tauzin, R-La. </s> <s> , said the leaders  seemed motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred  from the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. </s> <s>  He also cited  the president's need to placate the left by adding costly domestic  programs. </s> <s>  The combination of the lessons learned three years ago  and the scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result,  a budget that leans way to the left, Tauzin said. </s> <s>  Still, he said  he would probably support the bill. </s> <s>  It won't be enthusiastically,  he said. </s> <s>  It won't be holding my nose either. </s> <s>  I would have preferred  to spend more of this money on a tax cut. </s> <s>  I think we would have gotten  a tax cut, but for the scandal. </s> <s>  If the president had not been caught  up with the scandal, he probably would have followed the Dick Morris  strategy and moved towards the center. </s> <s>  Gingrich said he recognized  that some conservatives were wary of the agreement. </s> <s>  But he sought  to reassure them that the package served their interests. </s> <s>  He cited  a $9 billion increase in defense spending. </s> <s>  And he noted that the Republicans  had blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs in the  District of Columbia, national education testing and U.S. </s> <s>  contributions  to a United Nations program that pays for family planning in China,  which many in Congress object to because China has a policy of coercing  abortions and forcing sterilization. </s> <s>  Gingrich said the agreement was  the best that could be achieved when you have a conservative Republican  Congress and a liberal Democratic president. </s> <s>  Some conservatives  who had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. </s> <s>   Rep. </s> <s>  David McIntosh, R-Ind. </s> <s> , a leader of conservatives in the House,  had denounced the bill earlier as a Great Society type of big-spending  program. </s> <s>  Friday, after a meeting of Republicans, he said, Our leadership  found themselves in a bad situation and did a good job. </s> <s>  A few remained  outright hostile to the bill, as much for the hasty way in which it  was cobbled together as for what it contained. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Joe Barton, R-Texas,  said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens between  now and Tuesday. </s> <s>  I think it's the process that gives the president  the ability to stonewall until the very end and then hold us for ransom. </s> <s>   The Republican leadership in the House and Senate did a good job of  limiting the highway robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the  spending caps. </s> <s>  Also angry at the rushed endgame was Rep. </s> <s>  Gene Taylor,  D-Miss. </s> <s> , who took to the House floor and said he could not support  the final bill. </s> <s>  I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote `no,'   Taylor said. </s> <s>  We have stayed here this long. </s> <s>  We can stay a little  bit longer. </s> <s>  And I am going to encourage my colleagues to continue  to vote no until we are given adequate time to study the measure that  is brought before us. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Despite some disputes, final budget approval only awaits drafting. </s> </p> </d>
