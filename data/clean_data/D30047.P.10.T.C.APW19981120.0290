article= <d> <p> <s>  A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international  space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era  in international space colonization. </s> <s>  Russian space officials and others  cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated  from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers  (125 miles) above the Earth. </s> <s>  Success, shouted one exultant official  some 10 minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit. </s> <s>   The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in the  project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers  (3 miles). </s> <s>  Strategic Rocket Forces troops who had prepared the launch  were in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic  rocket fuel. </s> <s>  Russian and U.S. </s> <s>  officials said the launch was flawless  and the module performed well during initial tests. </s> <s>  They cautioned  that much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station  project up and working. </s> <s>  Now we only have 44 launches to go, about  1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of  the trust and mutual respect . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  the international space station is  going to be a reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference  after the launch. </s> <s>  His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch  was a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving  it could play a major role in space operations. </s> <s>  Today we made a  truly epoch-making step to carry out this project. </s> <s>  The Russian space  industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of  its commitments on the international space station, he said. </s> <s>  The  launch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the cloudy sky  above the central Asian steppes. </s> <s>  The huge roar of the rocket reverberated  for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the empty plain around the  base. </s> <s>  The mood at the launch pad was tense before the launch, with  space officials and workers anxiously making last-minute checks to  ensure there were no problems. </s> <s>  Solar power panels on the module were  successfully deployed shortly after it reached its first orbit and  all systems were working normally, officials said. </s> <s>  The launch of the  Russian cargo module, which had been delayed for more than a year,  ushers in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rivals. </s> <s>   Space officials expressed optimism that cooperation would further  promote world stability following the end of the Cold War. </s> <s>  We still  have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aimed at each  other, but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing  things together, said Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. </s> <s>   The 12. </s> <s> 4-meter (41. </s> <s> 2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched by a three-stage  Proton booster rocket. </s> <s>  Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat  in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and  communications. </s> <s>  Engineers finished final preparations early Friday  for the liftoff of the 24-ton module. </s> <s>  The rocket blasted off under  cloudy skies and strong winds, and disappeared behind the clouds 40  seconds later. </s> <s>  The international space station, the U.S. </s> <s> -led successor  to Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be  completed by 2004. </s> <s>  It will consist of more than 100 elements that  will take 45 assembly flights to complete. </s> <s>  Russia's crucial participation  has been hampered by the country's financial problems. </s> <s>  The launch  of the first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because the  chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford to complete  another part of the station that is to go up later. </s> <s>  Zarya is to fly  alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle  Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. </s> <s>  3 carrying the Unity connecting  module. </s> <s>  The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early  2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to  blast off next July or August. </s> <s>  The space station is expected to cost  at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs  24 billion. </s> <s>  It will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts  and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. </s> <s>  Russia has repeatedly failed  to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module, putting the whole  project behind schedule. </s> <s>  Having lost hope of getting promised government  funds, the Russian space agency has sold research time on the station  to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. </s> <s>  Russia rents  the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Russian booster rocket carries first part of space station into orbit.
