article= <d> <p> <s>  It was not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist  in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered  Democrat. </s> <s>  Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, was calling  to discuss a national leadership award. </s> <s>  Dr. Rymer has won acclaim  as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition  seemed particularly grand. </s> <s>  When she returned the call, she said she  was told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee  to advise Gingrich on legislation. </s> <s>  Too good to be true? </s> <s>  Well, Dr.  Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually  meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would  be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. </s> <s>   And oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to help  our efforts, according to a transcript of a similar chat with another  doctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives. </s> <s>   With the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns out  that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports  candidates for the House, has been sponsoring similar calls to tens  of thousands of small-business owners, including doctors. </s> <s>  With this  and other fund-raising programs, the committee says it has amassed  $62 million for the elections. </s> <s>  But campaign finance watchdogs say  the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising,  one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the  Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar  windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines. </s> <s>  By citing the  speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls  are a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who  might otherwise hang up. </s> <s>  Dr. Rymer says she was incensed. </s> <s>  So was Dr.  Stanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who votes  as an independent and was also called. </s> <s>  I was absolutely outraged,  he said. </s> <s>  Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category  of consumer fraud. </s> <s>  Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes  in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients,  said, I have never heard of that particular device. </s> <s>  But it doesn't  appear illegal, he said, adding, It's a fund-raising gimmick to  get attention. </s> <s>  Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit,  nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, This is a  new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware. </s> <s>   When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. </s> <s>  But  this isn't going to be investigated because it's members of Congress  who are doing it. </s> <s>  Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican  Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any complaints  and that there was no intent to deceive. </s> <s>  The national leadership  award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris  said. </s> <s>  It's part of bringing them into the process. </s> <s>  It's important  that they be recognized for the support they give the party. </s> <s>  There's  no quid pro quo that people solicited could receive awards for past  contributions, he added. </s> <s>  What most peeves Drs. </s> <s>  Rymer and Turecki is  the message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking  Gingrich's office and proposing the award. </s> <s>  They say they envisioned  a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol  Dome. </s> <s>  The calls, however, are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by  any of his offices or by anyone in Washington. </s> <s>  They are made by people  with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp. </s> <s> ,  a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron,  Ohio. </s> <s>  On its Web page, InfoCision says its 1,400 employees operate  1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. </s> <s>  Every word in the script  is approved by our clients, the company says on its Web site. </s> <s>  Every  conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal. </s> <s>  Besides  telemarketing for businesses, said Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the  center, we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative  political groups. </s> <s>  However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers  are instructed to answer return calls with: Republican Congressional  Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. </s> <s>  May I help you? </s> <s>  A doctor in Kansas  City, Mo., who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named,  dialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answering machines  and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion, which is legal in Missouri. </s> <s>   We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker, says a  woman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy. </s> <s>  He  is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much  as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains  to a single rate of 15 percent. </s> <s>  To assure passage of the legislation,  the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding,  To help us do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals  such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on  his advisory council. </s> <s>  Nancy continues: There will be correspondence  with the speaker, such as conference calls. </s> <s>  It's a great way that  he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern  you. </s> <s>  Or maybe surveys or questionnaires. </s> <s>  Later, Nancy says: As  a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker  our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor. </s> <s>  And  to be honest, he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could  help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution  of $500 or $1,000. </s> <s>  Now that would be used on the nationwide media  campaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really  need. </s> <s>  And as someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could  I tell the speaker he could count on your help? </s> <s>  The doctor demurs. </s> <s>   I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas, she tells Nancy. </s> <s>   Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my  own representative. </s> <s>  Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy  is located. </s> <s>  Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking  to? </s> <s>  the doctor asks. </s> <s>  The speaker's office, says Nancy. </s> <s>  This  is the speaker's office. </s> <s>  That I'm talking to, says the doctor,  double-checking. </s> <s>  Uh-huh, Nancy replies. </s> <s>  The law prohibits political  fund-raising calls from federal offices. </s> <s>  Vice President Al Gore is  under a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising calls he  allegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. </s> <s>   But the calls can be made from just about anywhere else, including  campaign offices. </s> <s>  Harris said the calls are in no way related to  the speaker's OFFICIAL office. </s> <s>  He added: What is more important  is not where the calls get routed. </s> <s>  People are more interested in an  award with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call gets  routed to Washington or Ohio. </s> <s>  Turecki disagrees. </s> <s>  I see it as basic  sleaze, he said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Gingrich leadership awards are thinly veiled pitch for contributions. </s> </p> </d>
