article= <d> <p> <s>  By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. </s> <s>  She and  her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario,  and every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek  before he goes to work. </s> <s>  She runs errands, like other suburban moms,  and spends much of her day taking care of her children. </s> <s>  But one thing  sets Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes apart from her neighbors. </s> <s>  As a devoted opponent of  abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a  series of traveling speakers, priests and protesters _ many of whom  have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion  and shutting down clinics that provide it. </s> <s>  She is one of thousands  of people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion  groups like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their homes to the  Lambs' founder, the Rev. </s> <s>  Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. </s> <s>   While many _ including Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters  of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility  when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. </s> <s>   These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when  he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent, said Ann  Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood  Federation. </s> <s>  It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the  extremist activity that is taking place at these clinics. </s> <s>  They are  still guilty of interfering with women's access. </s> <s>  But Mary Quinn,  a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home  to protesters, sees matters in a differing light. </s> <s>  Taking people  in like this is an act of Christian charity, Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn said. </s> <s>  `People  who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those  of us that who don't want to lose their stupid houses. </s> <s>  We take in  these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice. </s> <s>  Members  of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at  the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before  he was shot to death last month. </s> <s>  Although no suspect has been identified  in the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada  over the past several years, officials are looking to question a Vermont  man whose car was seen near Dr. Slepian's home. </s> <s>  That man, James Charles  Kopp, has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade,  and often was a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ. </s> <s>   While Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic's  door, some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about  doing so. </s> <s>  Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, is one of those  who has benefited from Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of  the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well. </s> <s>  He prides himself  on being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical  clinics. </s> <s>  And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he was active in  clinic rescues, in which protesters tried physically to restrain  patients trying to enter clinics. </s> <s>  Weslin stayed at Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes' home  only once, beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local  churches about the anti-abortion movement. </s> <s>  But during a stay that  lasted several months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking  access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. </s> <s>   He was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison. </s> <s>   During the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters  locked themselves in a homemade contraption called the oven, made  of cement and iron. </s> <s>  It took police officers several hours to lug the  device to a horse trailer that carted it off. </s> <s>  At the same protest,  one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic,  a move some protesters later said was an accident. </s> <s>  Abortion opponents  like Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes and Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances  at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn. </s> <s>  They talk  about counseling women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic  pregnancy centers, and their support of anti-abortion candidates. </s> <s>   But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block  access to clinics. </s> <s>  They describe the activity as peaceful resistance  meant to stop what they see as murders. </s> <s>  Weslin and the other house  guests of Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes and Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn come recommended from friends  and members of local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most  are speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. </s> <s>  And although  they say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted  by the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little  about their guests. </s> <s>  But Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes and Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn say they know a  lot about Weslin. </s> <s>  An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion  movement for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for  unwed mothers. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious  he was a man of peace who had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed  Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs. </s> <s>  Barbara  Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed ties to  the Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that the priest epitomized  a man of God. </s> <s>  I just knew when I looked at his holy shoes and his  simple coat that had been mended 50 times, she said. </s> <s>  He was humble,  a man who was doing this for a higher purpose, trying to save people  through sacrifice and prayer. </s> <s>  opp also has robust defenders among  the people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest  to protest. </s> <s>  E. Kenny, 20, said that his parents housed Kopp in their  St. Albans, Vt., home for two years after he spoke at their local  church in 1988. </s> <s>  During Kopp's stay, he was a pleasure, Kenny said,  always helping around the house. </s> <s>  He was a nice guy, kind of like  an uncle to us, Kenny said. </s> <s>  He'd sit around and play video games  with us and make us model planes out of wood. </s> <s>  Like Weslin, Kopp  was consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its  evils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was a gentle man who wanted to  become a Catholic priest. </s> <s>  He was always in a good mood, Kenny  said. </s> <s>  He never did anything violent at all. </s> <s>  Both Kopp and Weslin  have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests. </s> <s>  The men have  moved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at  the same events. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent  telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. </s> <s>  Weslin could not be reached  for comment, but it is clear that the two men have encountered each  other. </s> <s>  Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington,  Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called the mill. </s> <s>  And they  spent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. </s> <s>   Slepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes and Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn  worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media  and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ. </s> <s>   For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't  being heard, Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes said. </s> <s>  And then there was this horrible  tragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of the movement. </s> <s>   We're about saving lives, she said. </s> <s>  The FBI has not talked to  Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes, but Kenny said that agents have spoken to him. </s> <s>  The Justice  Department says that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate  the killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion  violence at various clinics. </s> <s>  It's fair to say that when investigating  these events, we will look at any connection between individuals engaged  in criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department,  said. </s> <s>  Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have  tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. </s> <s>  They are  mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their  movement. </s> <s>  In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering  other possible explanations for the killing. </s> <s>  Some say they believe  that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a  personal experience with abortion. </s> <s>  Others wondered whether the shooter  had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing  more abortions. </s> <s>  The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents  are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient. </s> <s>   One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed  on their Web site, suggests that the killing was the result of a plot  by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before  last week's elections. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes says she doesn't know the truth. </s> <s>   There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the  clinic because we are drawn to the same place, she said. </s> <s>  But you  don't know everyone who shows up and you don't turn to the person  next to you and tell them they don't belong there. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Fredericks  said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was  someone who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the  situation. </s> <s>  Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of  abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder  their efforts. </s> <s>  When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought  new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel  pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said. </s> <s>  In  many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading  rosary marches against abortion, Mrs. </s> <s>  Quinn said. </s> <s>  But with Father  Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we  were doing something sacrificial as a group. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes said that  she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she  heard women speak about choice in regard to abortion. </s> <s>  Then she  saw Silent Scream, a well-known anti-abortion film that purports  to show the footage of an abortion. </s> <s>  What I saw was the end of life,  she said. </s> <s>  She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where  she encouraged women not to kill their child. </s> <s>  She also began to  house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics  where abortions were performed. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes looked at her 3-month-old  daughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant,  a sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door. </s> <s>   She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone  else's child. </s> <s>  Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been  a partial-birth abortion, Mrs. </s> <s>  Hayes said, referring to a controversial  late-term abortion procedure. </s> <s>  They have the hardest time getting  the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. </s> <s>  It's  brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby? </s> <s>  There's  no question that these doctors are trying to murder a child. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Traveling anti-abortion protestors aided by locals; prayers or
