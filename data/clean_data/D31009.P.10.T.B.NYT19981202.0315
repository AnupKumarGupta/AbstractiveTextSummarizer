article= <d> <p> <s>  A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal,  President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing  politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form  a new government. </s> <s>  Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times  in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a  government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. </s> <s>   He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the  date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer  period. </s> <s>  It is wrong to see this government as simply an election  government, he said. </s> <s>  There are problems that will not wait until  an election. </s> <s>  Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey,  have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that  they do not want a quick election. </s> <s>  They fear it will produce a Parliament  just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented  Virtue Party as the largest bloc. </s> <s>  The commanders are also hoping to  exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister  Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom  they trust, from posts in the new government. </s> <s>  Ecevit must now try  to build a government that includes their center-right parties but  not them as individuals. </s> <s>  In a meeting this week the country's senior  policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military  officers have a strong say, set three priorities for the coming months. </s> <s>   It said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations  should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish  nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus. </s> <s>   Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political  crisis with Italy that broke out last month when the Kurdish rebel  leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome and then asked for political  asylum there. </s> <s>  Turkey wants Ocalan sent here for trial, but Italy says  it cannot extradite him as long as Turkey retains the death penalty. </s> <s>   Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among the few senior Turkish politicians  who favors the abolition of capital punishment. </s> <s>  Together with Demirel,  Ecevit is often cited by Turks who complain about the continued dominance  of a geriatric political elite here. </s> <s>  He is 73 and has been in politics  for most of his adult life. </s> <s>  Early in his career Ecevit emerged as  a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses. </s> <s>  Perhaps more than any  other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate  where leftist sympathies were often considered subversive. </s> <s>  At the  same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist. </s> <s>   He was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus  in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus. </s> <s>  He is also  uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism. </s> <s>  During his  terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined  efforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then  called the European Economic Community. </s> <s>  He considered it an instrument  of capitalist exploitation. </s> <s>  Ecevit has also disturbed the United States  by flirting with anti-Western ideologies. </s> <s>  In the early 1990s, during  an interval when he worked as a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and  wrote a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. </s> <s>  He recently  called for better relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains  some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism  that he developed in the 1960s. </s> <s>  The Democratic Socialist Party, which  Ecevit heads, is a closely held family fiefdom. </s> <s>  He and his wife carefully  screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty  to Ecevit is suspect. </s> <s>  During his terms as prime minister in the  '70s, Ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder, said Ilter  Turan, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. </s> <s>   It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective  he may not be bad choice. </s> <s>  On many issues that Turkish society  is encountering now, he represents an orientation which does not seem  to be totally in tune with the times, Turan said. </s> <s>  That would include  his position on issues like privatization, integrating Turkey more  fully into the international system, and the devolution of central  authority. </s> <s>  He has failed to grasp where the world is heading. </s> <s>  He looks  at and analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful  or appropriate. </s> <s>  Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives  modestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. </s> <s>   He speaks fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and  intellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. </s> <s>  He has  translated the works of T.S. </s> <s>  Eliot into Turkish and published several  volumes of his own poems. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s>
