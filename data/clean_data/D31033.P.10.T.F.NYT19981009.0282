article= <d> <p> <s>  A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust  trial against Microsoft Corp. </s> <s>  by four days, to Oct. </s> <s>  19, while also  ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request  to examine Microsoft's financial records. </s> <s>  Microsoft argued that allowing  an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will  make it very difficult for us to remain in business. </s> <s>  But after winning  assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow,  targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of  the U.S. </s> <s>  District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft  to open the database for perusal. </s> <s>  Microsoft had asked that the trial  be delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it  said was a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department,  which had added new evidence. </s> <s>  Last month, the government said that  in the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft  tried to persuade Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia  software to Windows customers. </s> <s>  On Thursday, the Justice Department  and 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify  about Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. </s> <s>  Avi  Tevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness list  in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever  having made. </s> <s>  The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive  who led the development of Java, an Internet programming language  that Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance  of the software market. </s> <s>  The government is charging that Microsoft  took illegal steps to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance. </s> <s>  To  counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia,  a senior Microsoft executive who has worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom,  an executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple. </s> <s>   At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that the  new allegations had no place in the case. </s> <s>  The Justice Department,  Warden told the judge, was trying to turn this into something approximating  a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case. </s> <s>  It becomes clearer  and clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying  to turn this into a broader case, he said. </s> <s>  You can't have this  bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging A, B, C, and  then talk about the whole alphabet three times over. </s> <s>  As a result,  Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay,  even though a more normal schedule would have the trial start  next year. </s> <s>  The judge did not respond. </s> <s>  Instead he entered an order  setting the Oct. </s> <s>  19 trial date. </s> <s>  Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal  motion asking for another two-week delay. </s> <s>  A response is expected next  week. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Microsoft ordered to let records be examined, seeks delay as case broadens. </s> </p> </d>
