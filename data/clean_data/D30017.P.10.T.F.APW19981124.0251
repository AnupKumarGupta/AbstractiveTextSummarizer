article= <d> <p> <s>  Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable  to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. </s> <s>  World Food Program  representative said Tuesday. </s> <s>  Though North Korea is suffering from  a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with  weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition  in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. </s> <s>  There  is enough rice. </s> <s>  The problem is that people are too poor to access  it. </s> <s>  The problem is poverty, Davies said. </s> <s>  The WFP is currently supporting  1. </s> <s> 7 million hungry Cambodians _ about 15 percent of the population  _ with food-for-work and direct assistance programs, but Davies said  he fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to  eat every day. </s> <s>  The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse  in North Korea, Davies said. </s> <s>  The situation is much worse than  most people recognize. </s> <s>  According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent  of Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and  20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. </s> <s>  By comparison, a similar  survey of North Korean children under 7 found that 65 percent are  stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. </s> <s>  Cambodia has  produced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects  another this year, but WFP statistics show that 25 percent of rice-growing  areas account for 75 percent of the surplus. </s> <s>  The majority of Cambodian  farmers are not producing enough to keep their families fed and are  being increasingly saddled with debts incurred when they run out of  reserves before harvest, Davies said. </s> <s>  Money-lenders in rural Cambodia  typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice  at harvest time, giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next  crop season. </s> <s>  Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of  modern child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded  health and education sectors in Cambodia _ have exacerbated the food  security problem, Davies said. </s> <s>  Davies urged the new government to  substantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and  rural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's  food crisis. </s> <s>  The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation  with the malnutrition of children is a crisis, Davies said. </s> <s>  Cambodia  typically earmarks about half of its annual budget to defense and  security. </s> <s>  In the 1998 budget, education was allocated 6. </s> <s> 5 percent,  health 4. </s> <s> 4 percent and rural development 0. </s> <s> 2 percent. </s> <s>  Actual disbursements  to the three ministries are often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted  amount as annual revenues fall short of expectations, according to  aid workers. </s> <s>  A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health  ministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from health  officials and the U.N. </s> <s>  World Health Program. </s> <s>  The draft was later readjusted  to provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in health spending. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Cambodian famine approaching North Korean level. </s> </p> </d>
