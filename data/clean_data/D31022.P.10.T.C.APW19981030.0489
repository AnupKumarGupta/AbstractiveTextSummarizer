article= <d> <p> <s>  A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween  revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring  about 180. </s> <s>  The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story  building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue  service leader Lennart Olin likened to a gas chamber. </s> <s>  Although  an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on  the upper floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity  of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation. </s> <s>   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant  group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when  20 people died in the town of Boraas. </s> <s>  On Friday, police said most  victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were  found at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials  said. </s> <s>  The injured included about 20 in serious condition. </s> <s>  The dance  apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants. </s> <s>   Police said the list of injured included Somalis and people from current  and former Yugoslavia. </s> <s>  The Macedonian Association had rented the facility  out for the dance, Carlsson said. </s> <s>  That person was not immediately  identified. </s> <s>  Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when  he saw the fire. </s> <s>  He said he raced in and pulled to safety several  people, including a friend. </s> <s>  His clothes had burned off. </s> <s>  His skin  was red and bubbly, Atta said. </s> <s>  Lots of kids were just screaming,  he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where several dozen family  and friends of victims gathered. </s> <s>  I saw about 10 people in windows  who just jumped. </s> <s>  They didn't even look down beforehand. </s> <s>  Fire officials  were alerted at 11:43 p.m. </s> <s>  (2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck  at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said. </s> <s>  The blaze was  already consuming the brick building. </s> <s>  About 300 or 400 people were  inside, police said. </s> <s>  Many escaped on their own. </s> <s>  Police rescued 40. </s> <s>   The Swedish news agency TT said the association had permission to  have only 150 people in the facility. </s> <s>  The building had just two exits,  one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg  was quoted as saying by TT. </s> <s>  It was a panic, Goteborg police spokesman  Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and  other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. </s> <s>   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. </s> <s>  What we know is  that there was an explosion, Edmundson said. </s> <s>  Olin said there were  indications that the fire could have been set. </s> <s>  The fact that it  spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire, he said. </s> <s>   About 180 people were taken to hospitals. </s> <s>  Seven of the most severely  injured were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other cities,  the report said. </s> <s>  Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest  of the capital, Stockholm. </s> <s>  The dance was filled with teen-agers celebrating  Halloween and a holiday weekend. </s> <s>  A night full of expectation, happiness  over extra leave from school and high spirits in anticipation of a  weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible  dimensions, the Goteborg city council said in a statement. </s> <s>  Goteborg  is today a city in shock. </s> <s>  Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited  the fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement  of condolence. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Fire at teenage Halloween dance in Sweden kills 60, injures 180. </s> </p> </d>
