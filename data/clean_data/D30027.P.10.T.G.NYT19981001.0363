article= <d> <p> <s>  Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the  nation Thursday. </s> <s>  After two weeks of deliberations he announced that  he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. </s> <s>   I want to repeat once more _ there is no program, Prime Minister  Yevgeny Primakov said. </s> <s>  It has yet to be worked out. </s> <s>  In most nations  such a statement might provoke alarm. </s> <s>  But Primakov was seeking to  calm an anxious public that was worried that the Kremlin's cure could  be worse than the disease. </s> <s>  It is not as if Russians do not have something  to be concerned about. </s> <s>  Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top  aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic  woes. </s> <s>  A main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by Yuri Maslyukov,  a Communist and the government's senior policy maker on economic issues. </s> <s>   It did not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit the street. </s> <s>  A newspaper,  Kommersant Daily, published it in full Thursday morning. </s> <s>  Not surprisingly  Maslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy, including  controls on hard currency. </s> <s>  A new State Bank for Reconstruction and  Development would be established using the nationalized assets  of failed commercial banks. </s> <s>  Wages and pensions would be paid in two  months, and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation. </s> <s>  There  would be huge tax cuts, a combination that suggested that the government  was committed to printing additional money. </s> <s>  The exchange rate of the  ruble would be set by the central bank, based on changes in inflation  and the balance of payments. </s> <s>  Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians  would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country. </s> <s>  It  stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special  authorization. </s> <s>  Exporters would be required to sell most of their hard  currency reserves. </s> <s>  That is an allusion to currency controls that sent  shock waves through the Russian public. </s> <s>  Russians have come to treat  the dollar as a second currency, and many people have squirreled away  dollars as a hedge against inflation. </s> <s>  It is an obvious stupidity,  Otto Latsis, a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. </s> <s>   People won't give their dollars away. </s> <s>  They will go to the black  market if they need to. </s> <s>  Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister  who favors free markets, said the plan was a war against the dollar  and predicted that it would lead to a shortage of imports. </s> <s>  As the  criticism grew, Primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk  of currency controls. </s> <s>  The rumors of the state's becoming a monopolist  on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense, he  said, asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily was  just one of six possible plans. </s> <s>  Primakov may be opposed to wildly  unpopular currency controls. </s> <s>  He may be worried that the plan would  would set off the panic buying of dollars, further depressing the  ruble. </s> <s>  Or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov's  plan while Russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement, $4. </s> <s> 3 billion,  from the International Monetary Fund. </s> <s>  The particulars could be modified,  but many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it  represents the basic thrust of the government's thinking. </s> <s>  Primakov  has called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money  supply, two themes of Maslyukov's plan. </s> <s>  The plan also has many similarities  with the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev-era advisers. </s> <s>   We think it is close to being a final document, said the United  Financial Group, a Russian investment business. </s> <s>  It is unclear how  long Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy. </s> <s>   The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has argued that the IMF should  not provide further aid until Primakov has taken tough measures to  build a free market. </s> <s>  Primakov has, however, sought to turn that logic  on its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will  depend on the fund's willingness to provide aid. </s> <s>  His aim appears to  be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund's fault  if Russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures  at home. </s> <s>  Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money,  Russia will have to impose unpopular measures. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Russian Economic Crisis: prime minister denies currency controls planned. </s> </p> </d>
