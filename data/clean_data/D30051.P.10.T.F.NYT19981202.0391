article= <d> <p> <s>  American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian  Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war  crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. </s> <s>  Maj. </s> <s>  Gen. </s> <s>  Radislav  Krstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast  Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the  first serving military officer. </s> <s>  He is accused of directing the attack  on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events  of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched  off, presumably to their deaths, as U.N. </s> <s>  peacekeepers stood by. </s> <s>  The  indictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during  and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. </s> <s>  1, 1995. </s> <s>   He is indicted both in connection with direct personal involvement  in the commission of these crimes as well as his command responsibility. </s> <s>   He is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity. </s> <s>  Krstic  was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion,  but was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica. </s> <s>   He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander,  Gen. </s> <s>  Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic,  both of whom are wanted by the tribunal. </s> <s>  And he is considered capable,  if he is willing to testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan  Milosevic, who has not been indicted. </s> <s>  Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor  of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,  called Krstic a very significant military leader and said she  was delighted with the arrest. </s> <s>  The general was only indicted on Oct. </s> <s>   30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so  there would be a better chance of a successful arrest. </s> <s>  NATO Secretary-General  Javier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large  should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice. </s> <s>  James  Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest serves  as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes, who remain  at large, that they will be held individually accountable for their  actions. </s> <s>  The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the  hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his  government would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping forces  to the necessary minimum. </s> <s>  Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate  candidate backed by Washington in September elections, said the arrest  of Krstic had embittered and upset the Bosnian Serbs and would  harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995  Bosnian war. </s> <s>  He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks  were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote. </s> <s>  A senior official  of a NATO country called the arrest very good news and said it  was a warning to Milosevic himself and others who have not been  publicly indicted that the murders committed have not been forgotten. </s> <s>   A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the  American sector, was a sign that this is a continuing process. </s> <s>   NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted  for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject  of sealed indictments. </s> <s>  There have been numerous calls for the arrest  of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they  normally are accompanied by armed guards. </s> <s>  NATO forces have never tried  to arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public  reaction from Bosnian Serbs. </s> <s>  Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic  are believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia,  which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. </s> <s>  Krstic,  who was transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who  has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there. </s> <s>   He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested  while traveling on the road to Bijelina. </s> <s>  At the outset of the war  in 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior  Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. </s> <s>   In 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion. </s> <s>  One Bosnian Serb official  said in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility  for anti-terrorist units who were given some of the most difficult  tasks. </s> <s>  Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't  talk about it, the official said. </s> <s>  But everyone believes it was  the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing. </s> <s>  In Banja  Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested  the arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier. </s> <s>   Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council,  now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and  promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given  the rapid arrest after the Oct. </s> <s>  30 indictment. </s> <s>  He also said that the  arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send  an important message. </s> <s>  Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict. </s> <s>   It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993,  when the commander of U.N. </s> <s>  troops personally led a convoy of trucks  to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that  Srebrenica would be a safe area and the United Nations would protect  them. </s> <s>  But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica  with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched  in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off. </s> <s>  Srebrenica  signaled the massive failure of the West, said Daalder. </s> <s>  It galvanized  the United States and NATO to act. </s> <s>  At a London conference later  in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe areas with  massive air strikes if necessary. </s> <s>  After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo  marketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began, signaling the  last chapter of the war and leading to the American-brokered Dayton  Accords. </s> <s>  In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member  of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest. </s> <s>   We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come  for Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice, said the aide,  Mirza Jajric. </s> <s>  The arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member  countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  met in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to keep the  peace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. </s> <s>  Under a deal pressed  on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000  civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political  settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. </s> <s>  Macedonia's government  Wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its  border with Kosovo. </s> <s>  Those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid  of the civilian monitors if necessary. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Serb General Krstic highest military arrest. </s> <s>  Directed Srebrenica attack. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
