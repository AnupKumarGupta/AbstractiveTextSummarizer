article= <d> <p> <s>  At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to  a ranch fence was a scarecrow. </s> <s>  But when he stopped, he found the burned,  battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay  college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. </s> <s>  On  Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma  in critical condition. </s> <s>  At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson,  21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charges of kidnapping,  aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. </s> <s>  Two women described  as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera  Pasley, 20, have been charged as accessories after the fact to attempted  first-degree murder. </s> <s>  Shepard's friends said that he did not know his  alleged tormentors. </s> <s>  Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery,  although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality  may also have been a factor. </s> <s>  Shepard's friends call the attack a hate  crime. </s> <s>  He was very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology  student here, said of her friend. </s> <s>  I admired him for that because  it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree. </s> <s>   A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch  man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian,  Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend  of Shepard's. </s> <s>  He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two  men came up and talked to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university  lecturer of social work here, said today between tears. </s> <s>  He indicated  he was gay, and they said they were gay, too. </s> <s>  Now, he is in a  coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in  Fort Collins, Colo. </s> <s> , on Thursday. </s> <s>  I don't think anybody expects  him to pull through. </s> <s>  Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied  at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United  States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his  father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. </s> <s>  Matthew Shepard  was born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much  of his youth there. </s> <s>  But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling  as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie  and her husband, Phillip. </s> <s>  Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver,  this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found  himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. </s> <s>  Set in a treeless  landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle and a busy  freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup trucks outnumber  sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolves around this  Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season  in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. </s> <s>  Although Wyoming often bills  itself as the equality state, in reference to its being the first  state to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly  voted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give  homosexuals special rights. </s> <s>  Wyoming is not really gay friendly,  Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American  Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. </s> <s>  The best way to characterize  that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened  homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing  plant. </s> <s>  Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university  within days. </s> <s>  One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which  drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and  straights. </s> <s>  He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled  the bartender, Matt Galloway. </s> <s>  He wasn't drunk when he went out. </s> <s>   Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today  that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard  out to McKinney's pickup truck. </s> <s>  Beating him inside the truck, the  pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural  subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. </s> <s>  There, it said,  the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped  him with a . </s> <s> 357 magnum while he begged for his life. </s> <s>  Relatives  said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body. </s> <s>  After nearly beating  the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said,  the assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the  fence. </s> <s>  The police commander said that when his officers arrested the  two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a . </s> <s> 357  magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. </s> <s>   He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. </s> <s>  The police  commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody  clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remarks. </s> <s>   Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. </s> <s>   Ms. Price lived with McKinney. </s> <s>  The police did not say what the other  three did for a living. </s> <s>  On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled  to understand the incident. </s> <s>  Shepard, some said, may have felt a false  sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plans  on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998. </s> <s>  The weeklong series  of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of National  Coming Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author  of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian families. </s> <s>  If  I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, said  Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. </s> <s>  Openly gay behavior is not  only discouraged, it's dangerous. </s> </p>
