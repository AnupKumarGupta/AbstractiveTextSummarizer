article= <d> <p> <s>  Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office  have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment  from new President Emile Lahoud. </s> <s>  Hariri is still the front-runner  to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted  sources as saying that Hariri was outraged that only 62 of the  128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a  meeting with Lahoud Friday. </s> <s>  According to the constitution, a president  must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet  through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members. </s> <s>   A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through  after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. </s> <s>  Hariri had even scheduled  Friday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate  and former prime ministers, but that was canceled. </s> <s>  The state-run National  News Agency said that while only 62 deputies told Lahoud they supported  Hariri, the rest refused to divulge their choice or left it to the  president to decide. </s> <s>  A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the  backing of at least 100 deputies. </s> <s>  The delay reflects the tug-of-war  among the power brokers in the country. </s> <s>  Under a formula aimed at preventing  the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared  equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister  and a Shiite Parliament speaker. </s> <s>  While the Christian Lahoud may have  no objection to appointing the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament  Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature are  holding out to emphasize their value. </s> <s>  The leading An-Nahar and other  newspapers said the delay could last for days. </s> <s>  But in the end, it  is Hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his  record in office. </s> <s>  Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly  created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed  by the civil war. </s> <s>  He is also credited with stabilizing the currency  and restoring confidence in the postwar economy. </s> <s>  But his government  under former president Elias Hrawi were dogged by accusations of corruption. </s> <s>   Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three  times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. </s> <s>  He  has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded  Hrawi on Tuesday. </s> <s>  Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuilt  the military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October,  has pledged in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued  administration. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Lebanon: Prime Minister's reappointment a question; economy good; corrupt? </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
