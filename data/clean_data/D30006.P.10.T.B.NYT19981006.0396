article= <d> <p> <s>  Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding  health benefits. </s> <s>  I'm not going to try and put it in dollars and  cents. </s> <s>  But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association  Players Association, played the public-relations game Tuesday by expounding  on the themes of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted  proposals. </s> <s>  On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin,  players from across the country held news conferences in 14 NBA cities  to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season. </s> <s>  We  want to show the public that we, as players, want to play, said  Ewing, who was flanked by five teammates. </s> <s>  Today is supposed to be  the start of training camp. </s> <s>  We want to practice and we want the season  to start. </s> <s>  But unfortunately, the owners have locked us out and the  season has been postponed. </s> <s>  The owners and players are scheduled  hold their first bargaining session since Aug. </s> <s>  6 on Thursday in Manhattan. </s> <s>   Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective  bargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov. </s> <s>   3. </s> <s>  The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on Monday. </s> <s>  Next  week, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season games  in league history. </s> <s>  With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion  annual income should be distributed, both sides have privately said  they don't expect to play a regular season game before December. </s> <s>  Billy  Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope. </s> <s>   He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution. </s> <s>   Standing a few feet away from Ewing, he said, I hope the owners  and commissioner have gotten the message: that we're serious about  a deal. </s> <s>  I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. </s> <s>  I don't think we're that  far off. </s> <s>  I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of rhetoric and a  lot of games being played. </s> <s>  But if and when the owners decide they  want a deal, then they'll get one. </s> <s>  But soon after, he began lambasting  the owners' latest proposal, which includes the eventual phasing out  of the Larry Bird exception _ the clause that enables free agents  to earn unlimited salaries from their current teams. </s> <s>  That clause represents  the major rift in negotiations. </s> <s>  Owners would like to implement a restrictive  salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player  can earn. </s> <s>  I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution,  Ewing said. </s> <s>  They're entrenched with what they want, which is a hard  cap. </s> <s>  And we feel with a hard cap, we as players, cannot survive. </s> <s>  We  would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal. </s> <s>  Said Hunter,  If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke. </s> <s>  It's a step backwards. </s> <s>   I cannot understand it. </s> <s>  If the intent was to reach an agreement at  this late stage or to negotiate in earnest, this was the wrong way  to go about it. </s> <s>  League officials did not respond to the players'  comments. </s> <s>  All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're  trying to take that away from us, Ewing said. </s> <s>  `There's a perception  that we're on strike. </s> <s>  It's the other way around. </s> <s>  We've been locked  out. </s> <s>  Besides Ewing, the other Knicks included former union president  Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston  and John Starks. </s> <s>  Marcus Camby also showed up briefly. </s> <s>  When the media  horde closed in, however, the third-year forward went to look for  his late-arriving teammates inside the practice facility. </s> <s>  He was stopped  at the gym door, which was locked. </s> <s>  They locked us out, said Rockets  forward Mario Elie. </s> <s>  Everybody's got to get that corrected. </s> <s>  It's  not on us. </s> <s>  They're the ones that closed us down. </s> <s>  The stalemate has  elicited talks of possibly bringing in a mediator in the coming weeks,  as Major League Baseball did in 1994 to help solve its labor dispute. </s> <s>   But the players are convinced commissioner David Stern and the owners  are set on testing their resolve before any genuine headway can be  made in negotiations. </s> <s>  That means missing paychecks in November, something  Ewing said the players are prepared to do. </s> <s>  Both sides are still awaiting  the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. </s> <s>  18. </s> <s>   Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more  than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should  be paid during the lockout. </s> <s>  Feerick's decision could give new leverage  to one side. </s> <s>  But if the players lose the arbitration, more than 400  athletes _ many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial  obligations _ will have their allegiances instantly tested. </s> <s>  It's  like they want to see how strong we are, Ewing said. </s> <s>  Based on  the proposals we've received, we're very strong. </s> <s>  So far, it seems  as though the NBA is dug in on their position, Buck Williams said. </s> <s>   I don't think they're too concerned at this point about making a  deal. </s> <s>  He added, We're about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right  now. </s> </p>
