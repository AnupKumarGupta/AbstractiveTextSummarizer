article= <d> <p> <s>  Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before  Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of  Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested. </s> <s>  She was there before  Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993. </s> <s>  She was on the  sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. </s> <s>  23,  about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally  shot in his home. </s> <s>  And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in  her hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly  praying for abortions to stop. </s> <s>  I'm heartbroken when I have to come  here, Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wearing  small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver  pin of baby feet. </s> <s>  It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,  she said, after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk  to a reporter. </s> <s>  The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents  and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the  news media, but people like Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio are the foot soldiers in  the abortion battle. </s> <s>  They call themselves street counselors and come  to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. </s> <s>   They pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. </s> <s>  Some  scream profanities. </s> <s>  Others, like Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio, denounce not only  the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of  doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. </s> <s>   For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is  more like a job than a political activity. </s> <s>  There is a schedule. </s> <s>  People  count on them to show up. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother  of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in  which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. </s> <s>  Two  decades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the fetus  was male or female. </s> <s>  I just felt horrible and I felt guilty, she  said, tears in her eyes. </s> <s>  I thought that if I was at the clinic doing  something, I could make up for that baby's life. </s> <s>  During Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio's  8 a.m. </s> <s> -to-10 a.m. </s> <s>  shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area  in front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the Hail Mary. </s> <s>  Others take  her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. </s> <s>  She returns on Saturdays, when  up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. </s> <s>  Similar bands of protesters march  in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local  protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country. </s> <s>   At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is  an odd sense of community. </s> <s>  Local protesters greet Dick, the security  guard, by name. </s> <s>  They sometimes see the enemy _ abortion-rights  volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket  or on the soccer field. </s> <s>  Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even  spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with  Slepian. </s> <s>  And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's  death. </s> <s>  Most of the protesters, including Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio, were among  the thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion  activity in Buffalo. </s> <s>  But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned,  for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio said, she will  not be there. </s> <s>  Instead, she plans to stay in church and pray, to avoid  the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable. </s> <s>  Glenn Murray, a lawyer  for Womenservices clinic, said: When people from out of town show  up, that is when we feel the most danger. </s> <s>  The local people are a known  quantity. </s> <s>  We know most of the local people by name. </s> <s>  Buffalo has  been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the  last decade. </s> <s>  It is a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters  from around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992. </s> <s>  They failed  to close abortion clinics, but 500 people were arrested in rallies  that snarled traffic and drew national headlines. </s> <s>  Those rallies, as  well as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had  an impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say. </s> <s>  The number  of clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped to  one from three. </s> <s>  And after Slepian's death and the retirement this  week of another doctor, there are only two doctors in the area for  whom abortions form a significant part of their practices. </s> <s>  The daily  demonstrators count this as progress. </s> <s>  But their perch outside the  clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders  than what they call rescues. </s> <s>  About 30 women a day might go into the  clinic. </s> <s>  After eight years, Mrs. </s> <s>  Lotempio can count eight women who  changed their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the  clinic. </s> <s>  Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder,  many clinic workers say. </s> <s>  While some demonstrators simply repeat the  rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the  parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. </s> <s>   They ask questions like Do you know what your baby looks like? </s> <s>   or Is it a boy or a girl? </s> <s>  Sometimes they accuse people of murder  and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. </s> <s>  Federal law  bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances,  and from leaning signs against its walls. </s> <s>  Some push the limits, frustrating  clinic workers and guards. </s> <s>  The rules protect people from physical  harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet  conversations into catcalls and taunts. </s> <s>  When a patient goes into the  clinic, the protesters take on a different persona, said Melinda  DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. </s> <s>  They scream and yell and  call us names. </s> <s>  They lie. </s> <s>  Some days we're immune to it, but other days  it's just too much. </s> <s>  Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday,  said she identified with the clinic patients. </s> <s>  When she was 23, she  said, she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant  herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. </s> <s>  She  began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march  in Albany. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Cadre of faithful keep vigil
