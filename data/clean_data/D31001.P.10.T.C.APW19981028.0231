article= <d> <p> <s>  A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will  not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. </s> <s>  de Klerk, in human  rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge. </s> <s>  De Klerk said  he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and  Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday. </s> <s>  The  man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding  by the commission that he was an accessory after the fact to bombings  in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor  federation. </s> <s>  Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman,  said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,  and would excise de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying  its release. </s> <s>  It upsets me deeply, Tutu said. </s> <s>  We have been scrupulously  fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been  engaged in a vendetta against him. </s> <s>  But we must and will respect  the courts and his rights under the constitution. </s> <s>  We fought hard for  those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk  now shares in them, he said in a statement. </s> <s>  All we are doing is  postponing dealing with the matter, Tutu later told The Associated  Press. </s> <s>  The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha has  died down. </s> <s>  De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment  before speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts. </s> <s>   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying  bare apartheid's horrors. </s> <s>  It has held hearings around the country  for more than two years, listening to victims and perpetrators seeking  amnesty. </s> <s>  The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone  for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. </s> <s>   De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism prompted  by leaks of the report. </s> <s>  The African National Congress, the liberation  movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the country, on  Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was guilty of human  rights violations in its armed struggle. </s> <s>  The report will be a broad  and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from  1960 to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule. </s> <s>  It  will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. </s> <s>   Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being  named as rights violators than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported  Wednesday. </s> <s>  In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more  than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give  them a chance to respond. </s> <s>  Only 15 successfully argued themselves out  of the report, he said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> De Klerk threatens to sue, will not be accused of human rights violations. </s> </p> </d>
