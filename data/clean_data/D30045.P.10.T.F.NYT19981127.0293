article= <d> <p> <s>  Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed  Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust  lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that  any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such  a new corporate behemoth. </s> <s>  Those divestitures would further reshape  an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the  low price of oil. </s> <s>  But the mergers and other corporate combinations  are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust  officials, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and  Mobil. </s> <s>  Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing  the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said  the boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to  consider an agreement. </s> <s>  Shares of both surged on the New York Stock  Exchange. </s> <s>  Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily  present antitrust problems in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition  in those areas is brisk. </s> <s>  But in retailing and marketing operations,  an Exxon-Mobil combination would be like Ford merging with General  Motors, Macy's with Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer  in New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more  than a decade ago. </s> <s>  In the United States, the deal would come under  the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton  administration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor not  seen since the 1970s. </s> <s>  The agency has blocked a number of proposed  mergers, such as the $4 billion combination of Staples and Office  Depot, the two largest office supply discounters, and two deals involving  the four largest drug wholesalers. </s> <s>  On the other hand it has approved  other big mergers, such as Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell  Douglas. </s> <s>  The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior  official said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's  Standard Oil trust before it was dismantled by the Supreme Court in  1911. </s> <s>  The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance,  they will be able to get the competition of one another off their  backs, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco,  said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School  of Law and an antitrust expert. </s> <s>  It may be that we are looking at  a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation  on the national level 100 years ago. </s> <s>  The Federal Trade Commission  recently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco  after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing  operations in Hawaii and California. </s> <s>  It is also considering the proposed  $54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have  to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon  and Mobil. </s> <s>  In the past, when there have been two mergers involving  the same industry, the government has considered them together in  deciding how to deal with them, said Terry Calvani, a former commissioner  at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. </s> <s>   But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals,  a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping  retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses  questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s. </s> <s>   It's a real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy  analyst at Bear Stearns. </s> <s>  If the FTC let this one go through without  major divesting, then everything would be fair game. </s> <s>  Why couldn't  GM merge with Ford? </s> <s>  While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed  by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history,  Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing  and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals. </s> <s>   Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case could  be so large that they are deal-breakers. </s> <s>  Other analysts and lawyers,  while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal,  said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations  and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum  of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials. </s> <s>   These are not absolute obstacles, said John Hervey, an analyst  at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. </s> <s>  In the past, when two big oil  companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states  have almost always become involved in raising questions because of  the high visibility of the local gas station. </s> <s>  When a state attorney  general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them  are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain to raise questions, Axinn  said. </s> <s>  Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing  and marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West  Coast, where they also have big refining operations. </s> <s>  Because the two  companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping  to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will  take months for the regulators to sort out. </s> <s>  The regulators examining  such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether  its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether  the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in  those areas. </s> <s>  Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to  permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production  businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and  a merger would not result in higher prices. </s> <s>  Hervey said those markets  are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major  American and European oil companies is only 17 percent. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Exxon, Mobil confirm talks. </s> <s>  Anti-trust case, sale of large units seen. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
