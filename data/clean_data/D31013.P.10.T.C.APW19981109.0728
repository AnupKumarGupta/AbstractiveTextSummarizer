article= <d> <p> <s>  While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday  to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling  vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement. </s> <s>   There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed  to be at large. </s> <s>  And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this  country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find  access diminishing. </s> <s>  There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked  to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day  to commemorate aborted fetuses. </s> <s>  Three times since 1994, a sniper has  used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor  who performs abortion, each time wounding the target. </s> <s>  The attacks  were spread across Canada _ Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. </s> <s>   U.S. </s> <s>  and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked  to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York,  including the Oct. </s> <s>  23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near  Buffalo. </s> <s>  An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted  for questioning about the shootings. </s> <s>  Police say they don't know which  side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals  throughout Canada. </s> <s>  You must realize Canada has the largest undefended  border in the world, said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in  Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. </s> <s>  Many women's  clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions  have been urged to take precautions. </s> <s>  I would suggest they be extremely  aware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business  day or after hours, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. </s> <s>  Across  Canada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying  their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions. </s> <s>  Some wear  bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes. </s> <s>  Abortion-rights  groups say most doctors are not backing down. </s> <s>  There's a great deal  of sadness, said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta,  that provides abortions. </s> <s>  But there's also a feeling of determination  that we won't be deterred or scared by these actions. </s> <s>  Marilyn Wilson,  executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League,  sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young  doctors from entering the field. </s> <s>  There are almost no doctors who  have stopped performing these procedures, even under the current reign  of terror, she said. </s> <s>  But young doctors with families wouldn't  necessarily want to do this. </s> <s>  They may not be willing to put their  lives at risk. </s> <s>  The abortion debate is only one of several factors  contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. </s> <s>   The national society that oversees the speciality says there are about  1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their  50s or 60s. </s> <s>  The society says long hours and limits on fees paid by  the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical  school graduates as they choose a specialty. </s> <s>  Another problem is that  few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion. </s> <s>  Women in  Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions. </s> <s>  Those  in rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince  Edward Island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals, forcing women  there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. </s> <s>  Abortion-rights groups  say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available  in Canada. </s> <s>  No drug company has applied for permission to market the  pill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability. </s> <s>  The government  has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the  health department says this can't be done. </s> <s>  It would be a conflict  of interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. </s> <s>   As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge  an application impartially. </s> <s>  Abortion was illegal in Canada until  1988. </s> <s>  Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions  are performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters  of Canadians favor pro-choice policies. </s> <s>  Yet public support doesn't  spare doctors from fear. </s> <s>  Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to  overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed  in 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom  as they reluctantly increase security measures. </s> <s>  Unfortunately, doctors  who are committed to providing these services will have to accept  a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life, he said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Canadians fear Remembrance Day may
