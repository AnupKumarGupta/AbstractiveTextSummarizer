article= <d> <p> <s>  House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of  shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday  night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican  colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past. </s> <s>   It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals  working together with the media who are investigating my personal  background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable  against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on  impeachment, Livingston declared in a statement after appearing  before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure  as it surfaced in news reports. </s> <s>  After hearing his admissions in a  closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave him a standing ovation  of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen. </s> <s>   My fate is in your hands, Livingston told the Republicans, according  to lawmakers who were present. </s> <s>  The debate over the president's fate  would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions  between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity  scandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. </s> <s>  The president  is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of  power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions. </s> <s>  Democrats offered  no immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's  admissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried  the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair  rummaging through his sex life. </s> <s>  Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual  counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he  had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker  that I was running for speaker, not sainthood. </s> <s>  He added, There  was a reason for those words. </s> <s>  During my 33-year marriage to my  wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing  so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston said in his  brief prepared statement. </s> <s>  But he attempted to draw a contrast with  the allegations against the president, asserting: I want to assure  everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff  and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them. </s> <s>  The  disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed  in Rollcall, a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty  among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the  president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be  impeached and tried by the Senate. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Henry Hyde, the Republican  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the impeachment  charges against the president, previously was cited by a magazine  for an extra-marital affair in his past. </s> <s>  Then, as on Thursday night,  Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president  instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's  principal accusers. </s> <s>  But no proof was offered as Republicans left their  conference, facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised  to be bare-knuckled in its partisanship. </s> <s>  Livingston left the conference  surrounded by Capitol police, not taking questions from waiting reporters. </s> <s>   His chief leadership aides immediately rallied in support. </s> <s>  Some  who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue  to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private  lives, said Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader. </s> <s>  In  its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not disclose  its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex magazine. </s> <s>   Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertised an  offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of  Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions. </s> <s>  It breaks your heart because  we're all subject to human frailties, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. </s> <s> ,  as he left the conference. </s> <s>  This is not a comfortable circumstance  for anyone, he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect  presented two separate issues. </s> <s>  We've got a duty to do under the  Constitution. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Speaker's admission of adultery will not affect House impeachment vote. </s> </p> </d>
