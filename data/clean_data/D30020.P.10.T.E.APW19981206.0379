article= <d> <p> <s>  In rites building from low flares symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron  lighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving  Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the  continent's Olympic-style event. </s> <s>  King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's  longest-reigning monarch, was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. </s> <s>   In a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's  tropical heat, she won the games' first gold medal in a time just  one minute off the world record. </s> <s>  Her medal ceremony immediately preceded  the official opening festivities for two weeks of competition among  6,000 athletes from 41 nations. </s> <s>  In all, 377 gold medals are at stake  in 36 sports, including Asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak  takraw. </s> <s>  But the king not only made the key proclamation and released  the royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium  and composed some of the music. </s> <s>  Songs written by the king, a talented  jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. </s> <s>  Thai  officials who approached him at the ceremony did so on their knees. </s> <s>   Others greeting the king included International Olympic Committee  President Juan Antonio Samaranch. </s> <s>  A cascade of fireworks in honor  of his 71st birthday Saturday and dancers who prostrated themselves  on the field welcomed the monarch to his seat in the royal box. </s> <s>  Then  came the athletes, starting with Cambodia and ending with the host  Thai team. </s> <s>  Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its team at the last minute,  was represented by only a flag bearer. </s> <s>  The Sri Lankan team was led  by six dancers in bright costumes, who delighted the crowd in the  60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers. </s> <s>  Each team was led by  a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard. </s> <s>  After the parade, five  of the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers. </s> <s>  A  giant cauldron atop the stadium was lit by touching a torch to a smaller  cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then was lifted on an elevator  and sent an explosion of sparks into the games' flame receptacle. </s> <s>   Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people waited  to take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of the games'  elephant mascot, Chai-yo. </s> <s>  One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old  piping engineer, who paid 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies  ticket, said, Thailand has many problems. </s> <s>  Asia also has many problems. </s> <s>   For two weeks, maybe we can forget about all these problems. </s> <s>  Several  thousand people without tickets milled around outside, waving small  Thai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king. </s> <s>  They also could  watch the ceremony on a large television screen. </s> <s>  Security measures  included bomb-sniffing dogs. </s> <s>  For the competing nations _ many sending  reduced teams to ease the pinch of the Asian crisis _ the games are  a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. </s> <s>  It's  not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a result that is  close or at world standards, said Li Furong, deputy head of China's  Asian Games delegation. </s> <s>  The main target is the 2000 Olympics. </s> <s>   Sunday's focus was more on pageantry, beginning with slightly built  Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at 9:09 a.m. </s> <s>   (0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a lucky number. </s> <s>   Bhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty. </s> <s>  The three-hour  ceremonies featured 7,614 performers in lavishly produced acts with  the theme Friendship Beyond Frontiers. </s> <s>  Performers in ancient Thai  garb paraded across the field, followed by people-drawn chariots. </s> <s>   A martial arts display celebrated Asian unity, and hundreds of primary  school students dressed in colorful outfits introduced the games'  mascot. </s> <s>  Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana  epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature  and performing and fine arts. </s> <s>  The field became a swirl of giant snakes,  swans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures. </s> <s>  Another performance  celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show, with four large swan  floats pulled to the middle of the field, each tethered to a giant  balloon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. </s> <s>  Fireworks  burst overhead, searchlights played across the stadium and lasers  split the darkness before the royal anthem concluded the program. </s> <s>   The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was 70  million baht (dlrs 1. </s> <s> 94 million), including a large share of donated  and at-cost labor _ part of Thailand's remedy for overcoming financial  problems that hit the games. </s> <s>  In warming up the audience before the  ceremonies, a Thai comedian jested: If you're Saudi, raise your  hand. </s> <s>  Saudi Arabia withdrew from the games at the last minute, throwing  some of the scheduling into disarray. </s> <s>  It cited a national holiday  and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw the move  as retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of  serious crimes against Saudi citizens. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Thailand's king leads extravagant three-hour opening to Asian Games. </s> </p>
