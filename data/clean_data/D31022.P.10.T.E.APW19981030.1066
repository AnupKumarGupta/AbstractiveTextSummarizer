article= <d> <p> <s>  Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance  the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead,  clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that  killed 67 of them. </s> <s>  Police said another 173 people were injured, 20  of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick  two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous  disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments. </s> <s>  Bent metal  bars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic-fueled strength  that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought  ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded  to more than twice its legal capacity. </s> <s>  Below the second-floor windows  lay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used to wrap those  who may or may not have lived. </s> <s>  I've been crying all day. </s> <s>  I haven't  been able to sleep. </s> <s>  I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends  are dead, 17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined  building Friday afternoon. </s> <s>  She said she had been at the dance and  two male friends of hers died. </s> <s>  Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey  at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. </s> <s>  Panic. </s> <s>  No  help. </s> <s>  No police. </s> <s>  No firemen. </s> <s>  Only kids helping each other, he said  from his bed in a Goteborg hospital. </s> <s>  Although Hersi, like many of  the youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow,  authorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five  minutes of getting the alarm. </s> <s>  But the fire spread so fast that even  an instant response would likely have been too slow. </s> <s>  The cause of  the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. </s> <s>  Fire Brigade  Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could  indicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time  before exploding. </s> <s>  The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor,  where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant  association in Sweden's second-largest city. </s> <s>  The association had hired  out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police said but  declined to identify the arrangers. </s> <s>  The crowd was mostly aged 13 to  18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly of immigrants or children  of immigrant parents. </s> <s>  Officials said the dead and injured were of  19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians  and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia  and unspecified Latin American countries. </s> <s>  Identifying the dead was  a wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted  with dread to wait for hours at hospitals. </s> <s>  Some were able to make  the wait in rooms off-limits to journalists, but many had to wait  in corridors, crying and teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they  looked for their pals. </s> <s>  Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday  evening. </s> <s>  The identification is hard not only because of the burns  but also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents  _ they were so young, said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital,  the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles)  west of Stockholm. </s> <s>  The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's  modern history, shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. </s> <s>   King Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement  reassuring victims' relatives that all of us in Sweden feel great  sympathy. </s> <s>  Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm  to the fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the  gutted wreck. </s> <s>  The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind  of boots my own children wear, he said. </s> <s>  On Friday evening, about  1,500 mostly young people, came to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to  assuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service. </s> <s>  The youths  were dressed in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers  had worn, but listened to delicate hymns instead of pounding disco. </s> <s>   They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently  not knowing how to behave in a church. </s> <s>  I don't go to church. </s> <s>  I'm  a Muslim, but I don't go to prayers, said a young man who gave his  name only as Sami. </s> <s>  I'm accompanying my Christian friends. </s> <s>  We lost  someone. </s> <s>  We're mourning _ that's all. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Over 400 teenagers jammed into Swedish dance hall with capacity for 150. </s> </p> </d>
