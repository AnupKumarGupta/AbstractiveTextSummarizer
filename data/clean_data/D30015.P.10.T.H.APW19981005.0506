Clark. </s> <s>  The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious  today as it was a week or two ago, he said. </s> <s>  We hope to make clear  to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity  of the situation. </s> <s>  Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic,  Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands  and avert a NATO attack. </s> <s>  We have to avert a clash with the whole  world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose, Montenegro's  pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. </s> <s>  Djukanovic,  a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav president to address  the nation with an unambiguous message that he has accepted all  U.N. </s> <s>  resolutions and agreements he made with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin. </s> <s>  Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's undemocratic  regime. </s> <s>  Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air  defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy equipment  out of Kosovo. </s> <s>  A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored  vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. </s> <s>  Belgrade had been  counting on Russia to block any U.N. </s> <s> -sanctioned military moves by  the Western Alliance. </s> <s>  On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign  Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President  Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. </s> <s>  Although  the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev  said the airstrikes could occur if decisive measures are not immediately  taken for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry  spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. </s> <s>  To avoid  such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army  and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian  crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace  talks, he said. </s> <s>  In Berlin, German Gen. </s> <s>  Dieter Stoeckmann told German  radio that NATO action could come within days. </s> <s>  Serb authorities  appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government  in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. </s> <s>   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo  Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February. </s> <s>  The  conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and  left more than 275,000 refugees. </s> <s>  Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent  of the province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence  or substantial self-rule. </s> <s>  Momentum for outside involvement has increased  in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian  civilians in the forests of Kosovo. </s> <s>  Although the United States and  Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence  for Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries  with Albanian populations. </s> <s>  In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA  offered to help NATO forces if asked. </s> <s>  KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi  said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper  Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and  we shall provide assistance. </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  if it is asked of us. </s> <s>  Krasniqi  accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having given up on independence  and having become the servants of the enemy, by agreeing to accept  autonomy but not independence. </s> <s>  Ethnic Albanian political leaders have  rejected the new interim government, which was drawn up without their  participation. </s> <s>  The council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic  Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Annan, ststematic terror, Bulatovic, imminent danger of war, Clark, Solana. </s> </p> </d>
