article= <d> <p> <s>  The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. </s> <s>  26: Since  the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August,  there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State  Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks  against the installations. </s> <s>  The latest and most disturbing account  suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department  received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little  to strengthen security at the embassy. </s> <s>  The pattern of negligence demands  examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. </s> <s>  Shortly after  the bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador  in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy  be moved to a safer location. </s> <s>  Her advice was rejected. </s> <s>  On Friday,  Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that  an Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings  outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November. </s> <s>   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists  were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground  garage _ that it called for more than a temporary increase in security. </s> <s>   Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the  embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and  defeat. </s> <s>  The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain  to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly  identical to the plan Ahmed described. </s> <s>  Since the bombings, the department  has been quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. </s> <s>   It would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions  was any more credible than Ahmed's warning. </s> <s>  No one at the State Department  is happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the  tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. </s> <s>   Of course, additional money would have made it possible to harden  defenses at more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security  budget. </s> <s>  But more decisive leadership in the department could have  assured preventive steps were taken in East Africa. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Editorial claims State Department ignored warnings of terrorist. </s> </p> </d>
