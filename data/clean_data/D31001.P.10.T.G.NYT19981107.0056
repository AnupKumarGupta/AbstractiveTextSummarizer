article= <d> <p> <s>  The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered  was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you  will go free. </s> <s>  If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. </s> <s>  After  more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the  commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of  people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied  for amnesty. </s> <s>  So the prosecutions should begin soon, right? </s> <s>  Not so  fast. </s> <s>  The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela  before talk of new amnesty deals had begun. </s> <s>  It seems that nearly all  of South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African  National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock  because of the report. </s> <s>  Suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the  country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and  many political analysts here are betting that an agreement of mutual  benefit is in the offing. </s> <s>  Already, three major political parties  are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing  the door. </s> <s>  ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was premature to  talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was  discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South  Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province  with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. </s> <s>  In choosing a  truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style trial with which to  close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation. </s> <s>   People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. </s> <s>  Society would  then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed. </s> <s>  It was a  model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering  how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past. </s> <s>  But  given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not  come forward. </s> <s>  Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated  by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. </s> <s>   It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. </s> <s>  Today's South  Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment, crime,  white flight, too few schools and hospitals. </s> <s>  So it may wind up settling  for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the  unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to  move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity  in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. </s> <s>  But South  Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and  to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test. </s> <s>  Certainly  the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its  past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed  genitals and near suffocations. </s> <s>  And the commission's work added much  to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960  and 1994. </s> <s>  But it will be years before the effect of the commission  can truly be judged. </s> <s>  Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? </s> <s>  Will  vendettas persist? </s> <s>  No one can answer. </s> <s>  One thing seems clear, however:  Four years after South Africa held its first non-racial elections,  a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past. </s> <s>   Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern  Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the  February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next  year's election campaigns. </s> <s>  You simply can't have this country torn  apart by prosecutions, he says. </s> <s>  Everybody is going to be howling  for an amnesty. </s> <s>  They already are. </s> <s>  Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu,  the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating  a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it. </s> <s>  He said such a move  would be highly unfair to those who came forward. </s> <s>  He suggested instead  that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted  would in effect get amnesty. </s> <s>  To be sure, there will be opposition  to any proposals to limit prosecutions. </s> <s>  More than a dozen human rights  and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn  such proposals as unconscionable. </s> <s>  The idea for a Truth Commission  emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about  South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state  to a non-racial democracy. </s> <s>  During the talks, the white National Party  government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. </s> <s>  In the  end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them  foot soldiers. </s> <s>  And only two high National Party officials, former  Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan  van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings. </s> <s>  In its report,  the commission called the apartheid state the primary perpetrator  of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former  officials as former President P.W. </s> <s>  Botha, his former army chief, Georg  Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. </s> <s>   These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty  For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution  of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused  in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions. </s> <s>   Lesser-known officials could face charges too. </s> <s>  The ANC is held responsible  for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal. </s> <s>  The ANC's problems are further  complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely Zulu-based  Inkatha Freedom Party. </s> <s>  Virtually no one from that party came forward  to ask for amnesty. </s> <s>  Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with  the white government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in  KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg. </s> <s>  Inkatha's  leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand  accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. </s> <s>  But prosecuting Chief  Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. </s> <s>  Part of the reluctance  to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another  factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime  and the evidence from the apartheid era is old. </s> <s>  So why spend the time  and the money? </s> <s>  At the moment, only one political party is opposed  to any form of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party,  a liberal group that was not involved in the violence. </s> <s>  Its head, Tony  Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that the more thuglike  your behavior, the more you get away with. </s> <s>  But he concedes that  his is a lonely voice. </s> <s>  At this point, he says, there is little  enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> South African Report out; justice or more amnesties, forgive, go forward? </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
