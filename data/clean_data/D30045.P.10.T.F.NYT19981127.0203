article= <d> <p> <s>  News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in  merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages  are back in vogue. </s> <s>  Even before that combination came to light, deal-making  was fast and furious. </s> <s>  On Monday alone, $40. </s> <s> 4 billion in corporate  acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent. </s> <s>  Driving the  resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by  major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues  internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy  will not plunge into a recession next year. </s> <s>  There are also industry-specific  issues, like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into  one another's arms. </s> <s>  But for investors, mega-marriages are not where  the real money is to be made. </s> <s>  Rather, it is among smaller companies,  whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with  stocks that again are near their peaks. </s> <s>  If Exxon buys Mobil at close  to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more  than $140 billion _ off from April's peak of $244 billion but three  times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling. </s> <s>   Which industries are likely to witness the most mergers? </s> <s>  Tom Burnett,  director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm  in New York, says more deals are a certainty in energy, which is suffering  from low crude-oil prices. </s> <s>  Burnett also says health care executives  are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings. </s> <s>  But smaller companies  may be a better way to play the takeover game. </s> <s>  Charles LaLoggia, editor  of the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said:  Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. </s> <s>   The values are in small-cap stocks. </s> <s>  Another reason is that deals  involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath  of antitrust regulators. </s> <s>  LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking  takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already  partially owned by another. </s> <s>  In the energy sector, Houston Exploration  qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by  Keyspan Energy. </s> <s>  He also believes more deals are imminent among drug  chains and supermarkets. </s> <s>  Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says,  remain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another  concern. </s> <s>  In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic and  Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. </s> <s>   Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores  that is 55 percent owned by the U.S. </s> <s>  subsidiary of Groupe Casino,  France's largest supermarket chain. </s> <s>  Both AandP and Smart and Final  are trading at just about book value, LaLoggia said. </s> <s>  Takeovers typically  occur above book value. </s> <s>  Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries,  a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading  near $39, close to its low for the year. </s> <s>  The company has $30 a share  in cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. </s> <s>   After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell  Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's  cross-hairs. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Exxon-Mobil talks sign of merger increase. </s> <s>  Internal revenue increases tough. </s> </p> </d>
