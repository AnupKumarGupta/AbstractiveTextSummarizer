article= <d> <p> <s>  A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led  to a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that  shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games. </s> <s>  India and  Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 1947. </s> <s>   A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed  a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee  that forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes. </s> <s>  Merchant defeated Mohammad  Saleh 5-4 after order was restored, but the incident not only violated  the sport's strict etiquette, but showed the distrust between the  two neighbors that often has spilled over into sports. </s> <s>  The referee  ruled that Merchant's white cue ball had first touched the black before  hitting the target, red. </s> <s>  Merchant protested. </s> <s>  With the referee refusing  to reverse his decision, Merchant sought help from the Indian team. </s> <s>   Several Indian team members went to the playing arena, and one of  them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing  platform. </s> <s>  Disgusted spectators viewed it as a breach of snooker etiquette. </s> <s>   It does not look nice for grownup men wearing neckties to fight,  said Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan. </s> <s>  We just watched the  whole drama, he said. </s> <s>  Pakistani team officials did not intervene,  instead staying in their allocated seats. </s> <s>  It was made very clear  to everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that  the Indians have lodged a formal complaint, we have also done so,  Khan said. </s> <s>  The Indian complaint, however, has no meaning now as Merchant  has won. </s> <s>  Indian officials were not available for comment. </s> <s>  Tournament  director Surasak Werapong said both complaints were thrown out because  neither side paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee. </s> <s>  The match was one  of the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut in style, with  elated officials greeting the opening with muffled clapping, in keeping  with the sport's etiquette. </s> <s>  A total of 19 countries are vying for  10 gold medals in snooker and billiards. </s> <s>  The preliminary elimination  rounds began Sunday. </s> <s>  This is the brightest day for us, said Manmohanjit  Singh, the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards  and Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body. </s> <s>  This is  indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more  popular in Asia, which is coming up fast, said Singh, whose family  migrated to Singapore from India several decades ago. </s> <s>  With the addition  of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sports. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> India and Pakistan snooker rivals disrupt Asian Games with flare-up. </s> </p> </d>
