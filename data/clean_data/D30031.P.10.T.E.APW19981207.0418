article= <d> <p> <s>  For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour  on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. </s> <s>   Let's go do this, said commander Robert Cabana. </s> <s>  Amen, replied  a launch controller. </s> <s>  Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat. </s> <s>   But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would  behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday,  forcing a delay. </s> <s>  NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch  Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which  was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. </s> <s>  The shuttle contains  the second station component. </s> <s>  The master alarm blared and red lights  flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday. </s> <s>  By  the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic  pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed  the cutoff by a second or two. </s> <s>  Sure, it's frustrating, said Bill  Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander. </s> <s>   But we do things right. </s> <s>  We do things by the book, and we're not  going to cut any corners even if it means just shaving a second or  two. </s> <s>  The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw  up their hands. </s> <s>  Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch  apart: We were that close. </s> <s>  The problem was confined to one of  Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. </s> <s>  The pressure dropped just  long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive  switch, then returned to normal. </s> <s>  NASA engineers spent the day examining  the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were  confident it would not reoccur. </s> <s>  Endeavour's flight is already a year  late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in  building the international space station. </s> <s>  The one-day delay cost NASA  about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay. </s> <s>  Aboard Endeavour  is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity. </s> <s>  The astronauts  will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station  piece and attach it to Unity. </s> <s>  Then, two spacewalkers will hook up  all the electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders,  and attach handrails and tools for future crews. </s> <s>  Until the alarm sounded,  it looked as though the weather would be the only problem. </s> <s>  Rain and  clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hours before liftoff, but drifted  away with minutes to spare. </s> <s>  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  and other dignitaries from around the world had gathered in the drizzle  to see Endeavour and its crew off. </s> <s>  Here we have 16 countries cooperating  on a venture to the future, said Albright, who was expected back  for Friday's attempt. </s> <s>  This is a good investment. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Astronauts all aboard for liftoff on space construction flight. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
