article= <d> <p> <s>  A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized  the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said  he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive  post. </s> <s>  Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he  and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member  Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. </s> <s>  23. </s> <s>  Although  a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil  the chances of Gen. </s> <s>  Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express  discontent at the choice and the process of his election. </s> <s>  Lahoud is  virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament  speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing  of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. </s> <s>  Historically, we do  not approve that a military man takes control of the country, Jumblatt  told reporters after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi. </s> <s>   Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common  among anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt  to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President  Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon. </s> <s>  Like Jumblatt, some  in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence  agents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and  1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander  to become head of state. </s> <s>  In nominating Lahoud, rules were not respected,  Jumblatt said. </s> <s>  Things were supposed to run in a more democratic  way, said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces  during the 1975-90 civil war. </s> <s>  The new president must be sworn in on  Nov. </s> <s>  24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term. </s> <s>  Jumblatt  said there is adequate political diversity and competition in the  country, implying that choosing a military man for president was  unnecessary. </s> <s>  Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fears  about military intrusion. </s> <s>  He told reporters that Lahoud will keep  the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army. </s> <s>   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political  support at home and has good relations with Syria. </s> <s>  He gained public  admiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending  the reign of militias. </s> <s>  Many hope he will cleanse the government of  nepotism and wastage of public funds. </s> <s>  Lahoud's nomination complies  with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime  minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. </s> <s>  The  government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials. </s> <s>  Jumblatt  said his party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend  the Constitution so that senior public servants can run for president. </s> <s>   Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic  bishops on Wednesday. </s> <s>  Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed the choice  of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Lebanon: Some oppose army commander as next President; fear of militarism. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
