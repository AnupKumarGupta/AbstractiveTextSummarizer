article= <d> <p> <s>  They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. </s> <s>  So when the  900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic  refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their  company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a  siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to  blow. </s> <s>  I think it's a terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, a refinery  operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the  main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on Sunday morning. </s> <s>   He stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime  could be delayed. </s> <s>  It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. </s> <s>  It's  going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. </s> <s>  I think the Justice  Department should step in and stop it. </s> <s>  Ernest Lewis, whose overalls  bore a Big E patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's. </s> <s>   The latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby,  he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated  by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's  generators. </s> <s>  But if the Mobil Corp. </s> <s>  has to be sold, Lewis said, noting  the gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large  as the Exxon Corp. </s> <s>  might be the least of all evils. </s> <s>  If we merged  with Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. </s> <s>  A growing American economy  that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for  Internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries,  in petroleum as much as any. </s> <s>  Those here point to the tote board by  the Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they  have already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned  for the full year. </s> <s>  But the numbers that matter even more are the ones  like 89. </s> <s> 9, 88. </s> <s> 9, even 81. </s> <s> 9, on nearby gas stations _ the lowest prices,  after inflation, since the Depression. </s> <s>  Which is why Mobil and Exxon  are considering combining into the world's largest oil company. </s> <s>  Some  people close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered  by their boards until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. </s> <s>  And that  is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of  Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers  Local 4-243 rang without stop. </s> <s>  No, he didn't know about that merger  talk on television, said Herrington, who also works full-time producing  lubricants. </s> <s>  He had asked some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier  this month, about all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing. </s> <s>   Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's  efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office  staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the  field. </s> <s>  One company's accountants could almost do the work for two. </s> <s>   But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would  ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into  gasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people. </s> <s>  Union  leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. </s> <s>   Antitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice that Exxon has  refineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the  other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical  industry's home. </s> <s>  The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry  set lining the Neches River off the Gulf, has become the prime provider  of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the  nearby Spindletop gusher. </s> <s>  With mounting overtime that can stretch  a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000  a year. </s> <s>  People go there to retire there, Herrington said, as he  drove around the plant's fenced periphery. </s> <s>  Lewis, in his 17th year,  is a third-generation employee. </s> <s>  But his nephew laboring here too is  the exception. </s> <s>  The workers streaming to and from the plant before  dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation  the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers  than how to attract them. </s> <s>  The cutbacks have, so far, come through  attrition, with retirements often encouraged by incentives. </s> <s>  But the  plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places  and gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the  best times are long gone. </s> <s>  His members chafe at the experts who come  in from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's  job. </s> <s>  In tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination  of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness  with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the  plant has become safer over the years). </s> <s>  They complain about the growing  numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks. </s> <s>   But with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement  savings in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining. </s> <s>  Some share credit  with the plant's management for the efficiency measures they agree  are necessary for true job security. </s> <s>  Some take the attitude that every  company is always for sale. </s> <s>  They will not be too concerned about  what we feel about it, said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant  workers whose future is uncertain. </s> <s>  But if they fork out $60 billion? </s> <s>   I'd look it over. </s> <s>  With most Mobil executives saying as little as  possible for now, calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a  company spokesman did not elicit a peep. </s> <s>  Union leaders, however, are  already squawking. </s> <s>  I don't believe creating new monopolies is the  way to prop up the industry, said Robert Wages, a former refinery  operator himself and now the union's president, by telephone Saturday. </s> <s>   Nevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause  in last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that  any company buyer would have to keep to its terms. </s> <s>  Many members, who  typically came to work after high school, are already molding the  oil companies' latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious  MBA's. </s> <s>  They're the biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant  operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring to Exxon. </s> <s>   He was coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate whose  white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station. </s> <s>  So they  go buy the second biggest. </s> <s>  That's one way to get rid of the competition. </s> <s>   I just hope it's not something like the 80s _ buying companies and  scrapping them. </s> <s>  Or something like the Robber Baron era a century  before, said Mabry, another operator. </s> <s>  Didn't the teachers teach  us all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come  back? </s> <s>  Remember that? </s> <s>  he said, looking to his friend, Lewis, the  Big E, for agreement. </s> <s>  But I better shut up. </s> <s>  I still work for Mobil. </s> <s>   Used to, Lewis said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract=
