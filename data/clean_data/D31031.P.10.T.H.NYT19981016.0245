article= <d> <p> <s>  Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal  spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for  the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided  aid to farmers. </s> <s>  However, no one can vote on the package just yet,  because it is not finished. </s> <s>  The deal that President Clinton and Republican  leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement  on the final portion of the $1. </s> <s> 7 trillion budget, not a written document. </s> <s>   That is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees  and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that  needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more  than 3,000 pages. </s> <s>  For example, still unresolved is a dispute over  whether airlines can create a peanut-free zone to protect passengers  who are allergic to peanuts. </s> <s>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other  members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting  the proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three  rows of someone with an allergy. </s> <s>  Congress gave itself until midnight  Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton  to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government  open. </s> <s>  The budget was due Oct. </s> <s>  1, the start of the new fiscal year. </s> <s>   The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near  to being written. </s> <s>  Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including  Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief  of staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. </s> <s>  Excluded  were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees,  who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. </s> <s>  Almost  everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with  the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the  $20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies  and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. </s> <s>  The  lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives  nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further  expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. </s> <s>  And some worry  that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly  revealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. </s> <s>   The elections are Nov. </s> <s>  3. </s> <s>  But several conservatives said that despite  these problems, they expected to support the bill anyway. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Mark  Souder, R-Ind. </s> <s> , said: `Most of my friends, who are predominantly activist  conservatives, are split about 50-50. </s> <s>  If tax cuts were your primary  thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. </s> <s>   My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. </s> <s>  We have no tax cuts and  far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. </s> <s>   Every member has a little different focus. </s> <s>  Souder said he liked  the extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price supports  for farmers. </s> <s>  Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers  were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Republican Congressional Leaders and President Reach Budget Agreement. </s> </p> </d>
