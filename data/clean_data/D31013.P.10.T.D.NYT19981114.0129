article= <d> <p> <s>  Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying  physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break,  most people. </s> <s>  There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage  cans at his home and growled murderer as they passed him in the  grocery store aisle. </s> <s>  Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients  as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby  killer. </s> <s>  Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a  week, pickets shouted epithets like pig to his face. </s> <s>  Slepian,  an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor  by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. </s> <s>  He might crack an occasional  joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and  on weekends. </s> <s>  Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an  anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar  demonstrator outside the clinic. </s> <s>  So when he was killed Oct. </s> <s>  23 by  a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in  the Buffalo, N.Y. </s> <s> , suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern  of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York  state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that  Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. </s> <s>  He had predicted  as much himself. </s> <s>  Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted  in that work, long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to  the pressure of abortion opponents. </s> <s>  He was an incredibly fatalistic  person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is  nothing you can do about it, said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old  niece. </s> <s>  And he was incredibly stubborn. </s> <s>  He said that women had a  right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor,  he was going to provide it for them. </s> <s>  Slepian is the third doctor  to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that  have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the  nation. </s> <s>  To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor. </s> <s>  To members  of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause. </s> <s>   But Slepian was far from either. </s> <s>  In interviews with friends and family  members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative  who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who  had rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had  no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women  who had multiple children they did not want or could not support. </s> <s>   He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become  emotional and politicized. </s> <s>  Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest  he was a crusader in either politics or medicine. </s> <s>  Rather, he was an  obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing. </s> <s>  Out of contrariness  and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow  anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that,  he paid with his life. </s> <s>  The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment  lie, in part, in his upbringing. </s> <s>  His was a family that took success  for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty. </s> <s>  To earn money  for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. </s> <s>   He made few friends, but those he had were friends for life. </s> <s>  When  their wives were sick, he called repeatedly. </s> <s>  When they were lonely,  he flew to their side. </s> <s>  Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell  people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes  a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because  it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse. </s> <s>  Slepian often  expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after  abortion. </s> <s>  Don't they get it? </s> <s>  his clinic staff recall him saying  more than once. </s> <s>  He had the same impatience for women like those he  remembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child  after child and no means of support. </s> <s>  He had the contempt for that  of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it  in the world, Ms. Robb said. </s> <s>  He believed that to ban abortions or,  just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to  perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found  so irritating. </s> <s>  There are 1. </s> <s> 5 million abortions performed in this  country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equipped to  handle 1. </s> <s> 5 million unwanted children. </s> <s>  When he was killed, at the  age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet  suburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music  and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored. </s> <s>  Slepian's  trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. </s> <s>   His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling  shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his sons  into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood  standards. </s> <s>  His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would  be doctors or earn Ph.D's. </s> <s>  We grew up in a home where there was  tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education, said Serena  Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older than him. </s> <s>  If you  got an A, it was OK If you got a B, you got yelled at. </s> <s>  The family's  means did not match its expectations. </s> <s>  Slepian's father, Philip, had  joined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes. </s> <s>   Soon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so  to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws'  apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y. </s> <s>  Once settled,  Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscrossing  the country in his old Studebaker, researching the origins of prominent  citizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for  small-town newspapers. </s> <s>  He sold articles by the hundreds, and was still  writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. </s> <s>  The success  that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily. </s> <s>  As a child,  he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister  recalled. </s> <s>  An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college  before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored  in zoology. </s> <s>  Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the  fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied  one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University  for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. </s> <s>  His friends remember him as funny  and obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline  who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool. </s> <s>  Bart had certain  beliefs, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who  is an internist on Long Island. </s> <s>  He always said you shouldn't sit  around whining about things, Schwarz said. </s> <s>  He would say, `Go after  what's yours and what's right. </s> <s> ' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced  in quirky ways. </s> <s>  He once insisted on going to the top of the World  Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights. </s> <s>  To get to the window,  he crawled, inch by inch. </s> <s>  I said, `You don't have to do this,'   recalled Schwarz, who was with him at the time. </s> <s>  And he said, `I  want to do it. </s> <s> ' Bart made it count. </s> <s>  He felt alive. </s> <s>  Forced to drop  out of school every few semesters to work, he lived in Reno with his  sister Serena, a widow who was struggling to take care of two young  daughters. </s> <s>  She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing  her tips with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barns at a ranch and  worked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration  hospital. </s> <s>  After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency. </s> <s>   There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his  junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice  from a doctor who was about to retire. </s> <s>  He had a soothing, unhurried  manner. </s> <s>  When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes,  Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for  months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for  her insulin injections. </s> <s>  The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,'  Mrs. </s> <s>  Durlak recalled. </s> <s>  Not Dr. Slepian. </s> <s>  In most ways, he was a  typical suburban family man, working six days a week and spending  his free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four  sons. </s> <s>  But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo  were under siege. </s> <s>  In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape,  the Rev. </s> <s>  Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion  leaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled into  the clinic driveway. </s> <s>  Slepian parked on the street. </s> <s>  As he pushed his  way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his  hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! </s> <s>   Slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private  life were futile. </s> <s>  The protests followed him home and the man who had  been so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center  of controversy and attention. </s> <s>  Once, he showed his anger. </s> <s>  In 1988,  when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his  home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor  came out brandishing a baseball bat. </s> <s>  He denied he hurt anyone, but  a town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window  and pay a portion of another's medical bills. </s> <s>  The outburst surprised  his family and friends. </s> <s>  It was not Slepian's style to make a public  fuss, much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters. </s> <s>   Stress? </s> <s>  his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about  the doctor's mood. </s> <s>  I never heard the word used in my family, except  as an engineering term. </s> <s>  He said it was a nuisance. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Slepian  did not respond to requests for an interview. </s> <s>  She expressed rage to  The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. </s> <s>  She said that whoever  had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would  be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. </s> <s>  She also spoke  out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader  who frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flowers. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>   Slepian denounced him as a hypocrite. </s> <s>  After the confrontation  in 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and  levity to deal with the protesters. </s> <s>  In 1993, when a man active in  the anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor's  garbage cans at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. </s> <s>   They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers, he joked. </s> <s>  He  tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper. </s> <s>  He told The  Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to  helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and  counseling. </s> <s>  In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly  calling him a murderer, his critics were inciting violence. </s> <s>  Slepian  accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction,  his friends said, but resented the personal attacks. </s> <s>  He thought  it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger,  said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. </s> <s>  So Slepian took a step that  few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. </s> <s>  He  insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom. </s> <s>   To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety, Slepian  began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized  outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked  two days a week. </s> <s>  He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing  for what they euphemistically called a house call, or demonstration  at the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. </s> <s>   Robert Behn, to breakfast. </s> <s>  Their hourlong conversation the next morning  was inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an attempt  to get people to like him. </s> <s>  He asked Slepian how performing abortions  affected him spiritually. </s> <s>  In response, he recalled, the doctor said,  I'm fine spiritually. </s> <s>  Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time  away from home with his family. </s> <s>  He planned to take a cruise next spring. </s> <s>   He bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. </s> <s>  He  had so many plans, said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple  for 15 years. </s> <s>  He wasn't done. </s> <s>  He wasn't done living yet. </s> <s>  Still,  sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear. </s> <s>   When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift,  Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would  teach it his eulogy. </s> <s>  He would talk about the funeral he wanted,  Mrs. </s> <s>  Fink said. </s> <s>  He said he didn't have a lot of friends and wanted  all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have  a long procession. </s> <s>  In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons  to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality. </s> <s>  A medical checkup had  revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs. </s> <s>  Fink said, recounting a conversation  with Mrs. </s> <s>  Slepian the day of the slaying. </s> <s>  A blockage is a sign of  probable coronary artery disease. </s> <s>  He was to have more tests the following  week. </s> <s>  I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,' Mrs. </s> <s>  Fink  recalled. </s> <s>  That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax  to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks  on abortion doctors that occurred in early November. </s> <s>  Marilynne Buckham,  the clinic director, sent it to Slepian. </s> <s>  He definitely took it seriously,  she recalled. </s> <s>  Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he  might have felt. </s> <s>  It was a normal day, said Tammi Latini, his office  assistant. </s> <s>  We were horsing around. </s> <s> ' That evening, the Slepians went  to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's  father. </s> <s>  Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed  through the kitchen window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his  wife and sons. </s> <s>  The protesters returned to the clinic five days later,  the first day it reopened. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Buckham, the director, said Slepian  would not have been surprised. </s> <s>  They have their routine. </s> <s>  So did he. </s> <s>   He never wanted a day to end on a bad note, she said. </s> <s>  At the  end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming. </s> <s> ' And he  would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Murdered abortion doctor a long time target of
