article= <d> <p> <s>  Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely  beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious  on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours  in near-freezing temperatures. </s> <s>  His death, announced at Poudre Valley  Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's  attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes  legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws  in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted  them. </s> <s>  From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out  to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman  at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay  violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby. </s> <s>   Two men and two women have been charged in the case. </s> <s>  The men were  charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree  murder charges that could bring the death penalty. </s> <s>  There is incredible  symbolism about being tied to a fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political  director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. </s> <s>   People have likened it to a scarecrow. </s> <s>  But it sounded more like  a crucifixion. </s> <s>  Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear  _ that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures  to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws. </s> <s>  Conservatives  generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over  another. </s> <s>  In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia  have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed  because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and  sexual orientation. </s> <s>  Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not  include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. </s> <s>  Ten states, including  Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. </s> <s>  In Washington, Clinton responded  to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pass the federal  Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes  based on sex, disability and sexual orientation. </s> <s>  Wyoming has been  one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since  1994, most recently in February. </s> <s>  But Monday, after Shepard's death,  Gov. </s> <s>  Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. </s> <s>   I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation  that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration  in January, Geringer said. </s> <s>  The governor met Monday morning with  Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder  Shepard did not want his son's death to become a media circus  and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda. </s> <s>  Geringer  said that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush into just passing  all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. </s> <s>  Be very careful of any changes  and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process  to race to this. </s> <s>  Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday  said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the  burial in Casper, Wyo. </s> <s> , on Saturday. </s> <s>  But they added that they hoped  the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. </s> <s>  Matthew's  death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding  of hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of  the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has  250,000 members. </s> <s>  Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming  and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation. </s> <s>   In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because  of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law  Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities. </s> <s>   According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11. </s> <s> 6 percent  of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996. </s> <s>  But Christian conservatives  warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights  laws and to curtail freedom of speech. </s> <s>  Hate crimes laws have nothing  to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with  silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, an analyst  with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to  defending faith, family and freedom. </s> <s>  It would criminalize pro-family  beliefs, Schwalm said. </s> <s>  This basically sends a message that you  can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists. </s> <s>   Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in a  series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame  homosexuality through religious conversion. </s> <s>  We have every right  to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norms,  said Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for  Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. </s> <s>   Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we  are being looked upon as advocating violence against homosexuals,  when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals. </s> <s>  Last  Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television  advertisements that preach the healing of homosexuality through  religious conversion. </s> <s>  Gay leaders charge that these advertisements  help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can  lead to violence. </s> <s>  Hate crime laws that are on the books in 40 states  have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal  justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at  Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. </s> <s>  Instead, he said, hate crime laws  send a clear message that society does not tolerate attacks on minorities. </s> <s>   We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they  escalate, he said. </s> <s>  Referring to murders of homosexuals, he added:  These crimes are preventable. </s> <s>  Offenders get emboldened if they are  not punished the first time. </s> <s>  Levin said that his research indicated  that homosexuals suffered higher rates of violent crime than the population  at large. </s> <s>  He also said that roughly half of the people who attack  homosexuals are male, aged 22 or younger. </s> <s>  The two men charged in the  killing of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron  McKinney, 22. </s> <s>  With other crimes, violence is a means to an end. </s> <s>   With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal, Levin  said. </s> <s>  Shepard suffered a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck,  as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. </s> <s>  Because their  social stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets,  Levin added. </s> <s>  Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message  to gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse in society leaves many  of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable. </s> <s>   While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death,  others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing  a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. </s> <s>  This  University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die, tied to  a fence like an animal because he was honest and open about being  gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense  and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering  and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated  individuals. </s> <s>  His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly  hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic  equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Death of beaten gay college student fanned nationwide outrage and vigils. </s> </p> </d>
