article= <d> <p> <s>  Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable  as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation  that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs. </s> <s>  It  almost came true. </s> <s>  In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who  is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led  to some of the world's fastest rates of growth. </s> <s>  He drove Malaysians  to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major  investments around the world. </s> <s>  He created a national affirmative-action  program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians  to share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian  identity and pride. </s> <s>  This year was to have been Mahathir's year of  triumph, perhaps paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration  of huge public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign  leaders and sportsmen. </s> <s>  But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia  is on Asia's critical list, its economy teetering on the edge of disaster  and its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable  political cat fight. </s> <s>  Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his  deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption  and illegal sex acts. </s> <s>  The move set off street demonstrations and aroused  international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends  in foreign governments. </s> <s>  One of the region's most stable and prosperous  nations is suddenly in an uproar. </s> <s>  It appears that as in Indonesia,  Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressures of economic collapse  have spawned a political crisis. </s> <s>  In all those nations, the result  was a change in leadership. </s> <s>  The question now is: Is Mahathir next? </s> <s>   The answer is far from clear. </s> <s>  Unlike in Indonesia, there has been  little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. </s> <s>  The ouster  of former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted by many  people. </s> <s>  Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here. </s> <s>  Malaysia  is not familiar with political demonstrations. </s> <s>  Unlike Indonesians,  Malaysians rarely riot. </s> <s>  Many people here were puzzled and disturbed  when they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the streets  in recent weeks. </s> <s>  What we're seeing is unprecedented, said Ambassador  John Malott of the United States. </s> <s>  This has never happened in Malaysia,  and nobody knows where it's going to go. </s> <s>  You can write a lot of scenarios  but we are in totally uncharted waters. </s> <s>  Mahathir, the confident  nation-builder, seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble. </s> <s>   An economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for  the last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent. </s> <s>   Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off from international financial  markets one month ago, turning his back on the foreign investors whom  he once embraced and who had fueled the country's rapid growth. </s> <s>  The  move had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian currency,  insulating it from the speculators Mahathir blames for the crisis,  and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy. </s> <s>  It  is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of  the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. </s> <s>  But few  foreign economists expect it to work for long. </s> <s>  Mahathir is attacking  the fundamental beliefs of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall  Street, a foreign diplomat said. </s> <s>  We are either watching economic  theory being rewritten or reconfirmed _ and I don't think it's being  rewritten. </s> <s>  The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set  off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar,  the man he had been grooming to be his successor. </s> <s>  Two weeks later,  Anwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days,  during which he says he was beaten by his jailers. </s> <s>  Last week he was  charged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could  result in a prison term of up to 34 years. </s> <s>  The harshness of those  moves unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized  Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals  and politically assertive Muslims. </s> <s>  For the first time in decades,  Malaysians by the thousands demonstrated in the streets and in mosques  and were met with tear gas and water cannon. </s> <s>  Many people were beaten  and hundreds were detained, although most were later released. </s> <s>  With  the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear  expressed by one Western diplomat is of a downward spiral in which  suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds  more discontent. </s> <s>  People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now  be numbered. </s> <s>  But few venture a guess at what the number might be. </s> <s>   Given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or  leadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm as  Anwar's trial proceeds. </s> <s>  But he has struck a harsh blow to the morale  of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard  to build under the slogan Malaysia Can! </s> <s>  In this generally decorous  nation, the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each  other father and son is disturbing to hear. </s> <s>  Anwar, says the prime  minister, is despicable and a sodomist. </s> <s>  Mahathir, says his  former deputy, is senile and insane. </s> <s>  Malaysians, who have  stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule with a mixture of  gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Malaysian leader's arrest of heir-apparent undoes years of social stability. </s> </p> </d>
