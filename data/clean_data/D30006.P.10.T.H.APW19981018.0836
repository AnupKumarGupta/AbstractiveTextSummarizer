article= <d> <p> <s>  In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association  and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether  more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during  the lockout. </s> <s>  If the players win, the owners will be liable for about  dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed  to appeal if they lose. </s> <s>  The league already has sued the players over  Feerick's jurisdiction. </s> <s>  If we win, I think it just emboldens the  spirit and resolve of the players, union director Billy Hunter said. </s> <s>   But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's  no guarantee that it will end the lockout. </s> <s>  It only means they have  to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent  to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in  order to avoid payment. </s> <s>  So even if he does rule in our favor, at  most it's a hollow victory. </s> <s>  The players aren't going to get paid Nov. </s> <s>   15 in any circumstance, Hunter said. </s> <s>  If the owners win, it will  remove the last wild card the players had been holding. </s> <s>  The sides  have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a  superstar tax on the highest contracts. </s> <s>  The league made a counterproposal  Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. </s> <s>   Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon,  then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. </s> <s>   It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union  is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee  in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. </s> <s>  We've got to get a sense  of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and  what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,  Hunter said. </s> <s>  The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout  was imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they  would not honor guaranteed deals. </s> <s>  In a six-day hearing over the summer,  the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from  being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting  lockout language into the standard player contract. </s> <s>  The Sacramento  Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract  in 1994, and it was approved by the league. </s> <s>  The union used the existence  of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected  themselves similarly. </s> <s>  Most players are due to receive their first  paychecks Nov. </s> <s>  15, although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them  to be paid over the summer. </s> <s>  None has received a paycheck. </s> <s>  The NBA  argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay  from employees during a lockout. </s> <s>  The league also called former union  director Simon Gourdine to testify. </s> <s>  He said it was his understanding  when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would  not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose  a lockout. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Pro-player ruling by Feerick would cost NBA $800 million -- appeal certain. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
