article= <d> <p> <s>  The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft  Corp. </s> <s>  _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable. </s> <s>   The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy  has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending  on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts. </s> <s>   Sponsored by Sen. </s> <s>  John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger  brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act  was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the  industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. </s> <s>  Farmers, laborers and  small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts  as vehicles of concentrated power. </s> <s>  But the trusts, large national  holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization  and industrialization. </s> <s>  Economists at the time opposed the Sherman  Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise. </s> <s>   No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in  Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained that nearly everyone  agreed that something must be flung out to appease the restive masses. </s> <s>   The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy,  restraint of trade and attempt to monopolize. </s> <s>  Yet while the  Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition,  it never uses the term. </s> <s>  After it was passed, critics of the trusts  derided the impenetrable language of the Sherman Act and called  it the Swiss Cheese Act. </s> <s>  But by the early 1900s, the political climate  had changed. </s> <s>  The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as  income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore  Roosevelt, who became president in 1901. </s> <s>  The Sherman Act has always  been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived  exploitation and the aggregation of power, said Eleanor Fox, a professor  at the New York University Law School. </s> <s>  The model trust _ and the principal  target of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil. </s> <s>  Shrewdly, Roosevelt  made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their  superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result  of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices. </s> <s>   Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained  about the company and the business practices of its founder, John  D. Rockefeller. </s> <s>  But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned  to light the nation's homes _declined steadily. </s> <s>  So Standard Oil, it  could could reasonably be argued, was an enterprising monopoly. </s> <s>   In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United  States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price  war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face  genuine competition. </s> <s>  When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil  monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company  swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard  Taft. </s> <s>  The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and  the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911. </s> <s>  Standard  Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. </s> <s>   Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft  chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller. </s> <s>  But there is no  presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction  in the Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author of Titan, a  best-selling biography of Rockefeller. </s> <s>  And Rockefeller, Chernow  added, never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread  public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Sherman Act, Standard Oil, Rockefeller, Roosevelt, Gates, trusts, monopoly. </s> </p> </d>
