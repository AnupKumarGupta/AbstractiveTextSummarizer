article= <d> <p> <s>  The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report  that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights  violations as it struggled to overcome white rule. </s> <s>  The 3,500-page  report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more  than two years of nationwide hearings. </s> <s>  South African media released  preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release  on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. </s> <s>  The release of the document  is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority  rule to democracy. </s> <s>  The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty,  was tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and  why of apartheid-era atrocities. </s> <s>  With the ANC now in power and facing  an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove  damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing. </s> <s>  There has  been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on  white governments and their security forces during the years under  scrutiny, 1960-1994. </s> <s>  Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission  would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that  the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting  a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. </s> <s>  But in preliminary  findings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said  the two movements were morally and politically accountable for  gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South  African Broadcasting Corp. </s> <s>  said. </s> <s>  The preliminary finding said that  despite ANC policy against killing civilians, the line between military  and civilian targets had been blurred, SAPA said. </s> <s>  It condemned the  planting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents,  torture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for  killing political opponents. </s> <s>  It said the party must accept responsibility  for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,  Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club,  accused of killings, torture and kidnappings. </s> <s>  The commission also  said the PAC was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy  in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed  by blacks. </s> <s>  Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria,  would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC. </s> <s>   I do expect various responses (to the report). </s> <s>  I do not expect everyone  to agree. </s> <s>  It will lead to healthy debate, he said. </s> <s>  He said that  if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses,  it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether  to proceed. </s> <s>  The director is appointed by the government. </s> <s>  The commission's  work is designed to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa,  and to establish the principle of accountability, Omar said. </s> <s>  The  ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying  weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were  in the offing. </s> <s>  The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request  a meeting with commissioners earlier this month. </s> <s>  The panel refused,  to avoid appearing biased. </s> <s>  On Monday, it rejected with contempt  suggestions ANC officials themselves had leaked the findings. </s> <s>  Constand  Viljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC  had done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even-handed. </s> <s>   Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed  during a just war. </s> <s>  F.W. </s> <s>  de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president,  meanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission  report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. </s> <s>   Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court, Omar said,  but added he would regret any court-ordered delay. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> ANC guilty of human of human rights violations in struggle to end apartheid. </s> </p> </d>
