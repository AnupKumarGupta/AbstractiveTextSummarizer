article= <d> <p> <s>  With NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. </s> <s>  envoy Richard  Holbrooke delivered a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president  to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. </s> <s>   But Slobodan Milosevic showed no signs of backing down. </s> <s>  Following  his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement  denouncing NATO threats as a criminal act that favored separatist  ethnic Albanian guerrillas. </s> <s>  The statement, broadcast by government  television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province  for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat  to other countries in the southern Balkans. </s> <s>  Holbrooke, the U.S. </s> <s>  ambassador-designate  to the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday  after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior  NATO officials. </s> <s>  Holbrooke issued no statement after the meeting. </s> <s>  Before  boarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke  said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved  since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air  raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian  separatists. </s> <s>  Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic  the extreme gravity of the situation. </s> <s>  Holbrooke negotiated the  peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended the  3 1/2 year Bosnian war in 1995. </s> <s>  In Washington, U.S. </s> <s>  President Bill  Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic was playing the classic  game of making false promises to avoid NATO military strikes. </s> <s>  Clinton,  in a telephone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's  compliance with U.N. </s> <s>  demands must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible,  press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. </s> <s>  What happens  next depends on President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted the president  telling the Russian leader, who has opposed the use of force against  Moscow's longtime ally. </s> <s>  As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through  negotiations, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision  on NATO military action was imminent. </s> <s>  We are getting ready for NATO  action and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken,  Cook told reporters after a special session of the Cabinet called  by Prime Minister Tony Blair. </s> <s>  In Brussels, NATO officials said they  were ready to launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order  to attack. </s> <s>  If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a  senior NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance  could unleash a fully fledged air campaign involving hundreds  of planes. </s> <s>  At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said  Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians  even after a U.N. </s> <s>  resolution demanded a cease-fire. </s> <s>  In a widely anticipated  report to the Security Council, Annan listed apparent violations of  a Sept. </s> <s>  23 U.N. </s> <s>  resolution, decried the appalling atrocities in  Kosovo, and said it was clear beyond any reasonable doubt that  Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them. </s> <s>  The U.N. </s> <s>  chief  also said rebel forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible  for human rights violations, a charge the KLA quickly denied. </s> <s>  NATO  countries had been awaiting the U.N. </s> <s>  chief's report to determine whether  to use military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who  are seeking autonomy like they had until 1989, if not independence,  from Yugoslavia. </s> <s>  Albanians in the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. </s> <s>   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. </s> <s>   State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration  believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid down by the U.N. </s> <s>   Security Council. </s> <s>  Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire,  the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian  leaders and the continued presence of major army units in southeastern  Kosovo near Albania's border. </s> <s>  The European Union nations were divided  Monday on whether to launch air strikes without U.N. </s> <s>  Security Council  backing. </s> <s>  The EU foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to  tighten economic sanctions against Milosevic, but it was unlikely  that stricter travel curbs for Yugoslav officials and freezing more  Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more than symbolic. </s> <s>  Meanwhile,  Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament  Monday that the country is faced with the imminent danger of war. </s> <s>   Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. </s> <s>   The threats are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. </s> <s>   And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced  with the imminent danger of war. </s> <s>  Yugoslavia has to defend itself if  it was attacked. </s> <s>  One option was for parliament to declare a state  of emergency _ a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. </s> <s>   But the parliament voted to introduce the measure when the first  bomb drops on our territory. </s> <s>  In an attempt to head off NATO action,  Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for  an investigation by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation  in Europe. </s> <s>  Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo  until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored. </s> <s>  The prime  minister also said there was no longer any fighting in Kosovo, which  has 2 million residents. </s> <s>  He said five of the 10 special police units  had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to their  barracks in the province. </s> <s>  One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition  of anonymity, said there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav  army troops out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized  brigade that pulled out Sunday. </s> <s>  Some army units remain in the field,  and there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly  among refugees, tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills  and forests without shelter. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> US envoy tells Milosevic, stop Kosovo crackdown or face NATO airstrikes. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
