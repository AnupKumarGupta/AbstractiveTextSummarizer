article= <d> <p> <s>  Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday  to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire,  but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered. </s> <s>   How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall  packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing  panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap  out of second-story windows? </s> <s>  As long as the technicians haven't  established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or  not, Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening. </s> <s>   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a 50-50 chance that  the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had  tracked down new clues. </s> <s>  But Noren later retracted the remark, saying  he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded. </s> <s>  As investigators  worked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies,  bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released  from hospital. </s> <s>  Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in  the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. </s> <s>  Most of the victims  were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including  Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia. </s> <s>  The  first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented  Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed  the fire squads' response by several minutes. </s> <s>  Per-Olof Ortarsen of  Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand  that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going  on and where to send fire trucks. </s> <s>  The first fire trucks and rescue  squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received,  Ortarsen told a news conference. </s> <s>  He and other officials declined to  comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the  mostly immigrant victims. </s> <s>  But the minutes of delay felt endless to  those caught in the terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily  of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response. </s> <s>  No help. </s> <s>   No police. </s> <s>  No firemen, 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc  jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. </s> <s>  Just  kids helping kids. </s> <s>  And once the squads arrived, the kids were then  blocked from helping, they say. </s> <s>  We could have saved more young people  if only police hadn't stopped us, Mohanned Hussein was quoted as  saying by the newspaper Expressen. </s> <s>  On Saturday, hundreds of people  stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles  as they attempted to come to grips with catastrophe. </s> <s>  In the parking  lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams,  mourners had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets,  candles and cards of remembrance. </s> <s>  The cards' inscriptions were brief  _ I will see you in heaven, We miss you _ and the people who  stood reading them also had few words. </s> <s>  I just wanted to show my  sympathy. </s> <s>  I think about them. </s> <s>  There's nothing else we can do, said  Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the fire's victims. </s> <s>  It's  damn difficult, said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a friend in  the blaze. </s> <s>  Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely  disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to show  the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull  through despair. </s> <s>  I can't give them hope. </s> <s>  Consolation is enough,  he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars. </s> <s>  Many of  those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked looks  the rest of their lives. </s> <s>  Authorities say the explosive fire quickly  raised the temperature in the hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F). </s> <s>  The hall  was packed far beyond its capacity. </s> <s>  Licensed to hold a maximum of  150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the  fire hit. </s> <s>  One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there  were conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire  came up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there  after breaking out in the second-floor rooms. </s> <s>  The worst previous fire  disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died  in a hotel fire. </s> <s>  Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest city with about  435,000 people, is 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> As identification of victims begins, experts seek cause of dancehall fire. </s> </p> </d>
