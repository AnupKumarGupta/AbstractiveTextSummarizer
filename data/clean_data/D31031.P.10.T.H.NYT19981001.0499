article= <d> <p> <s>  Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone  in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the  Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife  habitat in Alaska. </s> <s>  The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across  the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian  Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King  Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. </s> <s>  Without the  road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King Cove must continue  to use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risking  dangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage. </s> <s>   Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent  that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory  birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better  alternative. </s> <s>  The vote Thursday, 59-38, was a victory for the state's  congressional delegation. </s> <s>  But with President Clinton likely to veto  the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors  can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely  to emerge just before Congress heads home for the Nov. </s> <s>  3 elections. </s> <s>   Three Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted  for it. </s> <s>  The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will  veto a big spending bill if it contains an array of anti-environmental  provisions that are under consideration. </s> <s>  Indeed, the White House seems  to be itching for a partisan fight over environmental priorities. </s> <s>   But while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to engage  in that broad fight, they were willing Thursday to cast their lot  with the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski,  both Republicans. </s> <s>  A companion bill in the House, sponsored by Rep. </s> <s>   Don Young of Alaska, also a Republican, has not come to the floor. </s> <s>   Even Sen. </s> <s>  John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalists,  voted for the road. </s> <s>  Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score  of environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing  the road, environmental advocates said Thursday. </s> <s>  They speculated that  the senator had changed his position out of deference to the power  of Stevens, who as chairman of the Appropriations Committee exerts  tremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bills are in  their final stages. </s> <s>  A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly for  the road after Alaska's senators convinced him of its merits. </s> <s>  Stevens  said in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land was  off limits to development and that vital health services were being  denied to his state's residents. </s> <s>  We can't use it without permission  from some bureaucrat who is compelled by extreme environmentalists,  he said. </s> <s>  They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek  refuge, the smallest wilderness in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it  can't move its border 60 feet. </s> <s>  But Sen. </s> <s>  Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. </s> <s> , called  the road project a dangerous precedent. </s> <s>  Building a road through  a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be  the first time in the nation we have voted deliberately to authorize  a road through a wilderness area, Bumpers said. </s> <s>  And once you go  down that road, nobody knows where it is going to end. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Alaskan Wilderness Road Provision May Be Attached to Spending Bill. </s> </p> </d>
