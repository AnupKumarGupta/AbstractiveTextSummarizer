article= <d> <p> <s>  With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent  dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday  in China's highest-profile dissident trials in two years. </s> <s>  Qin Yongmin's  and Wang Youcai's families were running out of options Wednesday to  help the pair, leading organizers of a budding opposition political  party. </s> <s>  Qin's family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate  People's Court, but court officials denied the request. </s> <s>  Police have  detained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressures  have been used on others, family members said. </s> <s>  Given the interference,  Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted. </s> <s>  Whether he has  a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the government has already decided,  Hu Jiangxia said. </s> <s>  Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities  500 kilometers (300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only  by family and a few observers selected by the courts. </s> <s>  Qin, 44, and  Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of state power, apparently  for helping to organize the China Democracy Party. </s> <s>  They face from  10 years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects  of the law. </s> <s>  By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party,  the ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination  to crush challenges to its monopoly on power. </s> <s>  Authorities have detained  or questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17-day-old  crackdown. </s> <s>  Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student  leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among  the most active and influential members of China's dissident community. </s> <s>   A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu Wenli, was  also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged. </s> <s>  To prevent displays  of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police have detained at least  ten dissidents in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based  rights group reported. </s> <s>  The Information Center of Human Rights and  Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed  to be in custody. </s> <s>  To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal  rights guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders,  his wife said. </s> <s>  Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while  I was doing this, some people were doing things to stop me, Hu Jiangxia  said. </s> <s>  During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police  official stormed in and said, `Don't do anything for them. </s> <s>  Don't  take this case. </s> <s>  Whoever takes the case, you can't win,' Hu recounted. </s> <s>   Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang  said. </s> <s>  The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed  to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hours and then called  Qin's family to withdraw. </s> <s>  Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's  family argued over whether to attend the trial. </s> <s>  Qin Xiaoguang said  he and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness,  but another brother will go. </s> <s>  Three dissidents from northeastern China  sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's  Court appealing for fair trials, the Information Center said. </s> <s>  It added  that authorities violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and  Qin have adequate representation. </s> <s>  The letter was the latest in a string  of petitions demonstrating the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the  idea of the China Democracy Party. </s> <s>  Since Wang publicly announced in  June that he and others in Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents  in at least 14 provinces and cities have set up party branches. </s> <s>  Authorities  have refused their applications to register the party as required  by law. </s> <s>  Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has  put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. </s> <s>   He was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year  sentence. </s> <s>  In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Police scare off lawyers; dissidents forced to defend themselves in trial. </s> </p> </d>
