article= <d> <p> <s>  The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking  shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition  of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. </s> <s>  Despite everything  that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government  or the Spanish government, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said  in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. </s> <s>  In  a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said  Wednesday: The government should not have any opinion about the  extradition. </s> <s>  British police, acting on an international arrest warrant  from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing  general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. </s> <s>   The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to  stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year  dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. </s> <s>   But it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears it  could damage economic relations. </s> <s>  In 1997, seven years after Pinochet  left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile, followed  closely by Britain. </s> <s>  Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that  Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical  Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within  his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. </s> <s>   This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty  but nobody seems to understand this, he said. </s> <s>  Blair added that should  Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and  act as if he were a judge, should he be required to make a decision  on an extradition request from Spain. </s> <s>  The tone of the British Prime  Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with  Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter  Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for  Pinochet gut-wrenching. </s> <s>  The European extradition convention gives  Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British  authorities via the Spanish government. </s> <s>  But while Spanish Prime Minister  Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the  process if it reaches his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never  have to do so. </s> <s>  Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have  appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile  and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. </s> <s>  Depending on  the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition  request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government  will never have to pronounce on it, Aznar was quoted as saying in  Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. </s> <s>  The appeals argue  that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are  none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international  courts. </s> <s>  A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision  in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> British and Spanish governments leave extradition of Pinochet to courts. </s> </p> </d>
