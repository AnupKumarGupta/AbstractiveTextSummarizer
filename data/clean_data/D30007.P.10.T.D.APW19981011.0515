article= <d> <p> <s>  A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan  allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines, showing the  confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base. </s> <s>   Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila  River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery  into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers  (two miles) away. </s> <s>  Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government  forces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed  to respond to Sunday's attacks. </s> <s>  Some troops reportedly retreated through  a single road corridor leading out of the town. </s> <s>  On Saturday, the rebels  said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to  land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. </s> <s>  In Kinshasa,  the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the  victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. </s> <s>  It was not possible  to confirm independently either claim. </s> <s>  Kalunga said the airport, although  still under government control, was in effect unoperational because  of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby. </s> <s>  War-weary, physically  exhausted and sweaty, hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers  marched through dense tropical forest went to reinforce their comrades  at Kindu. </s> <s>  After a week of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters had made  little progress and failed to capture the town outright. </s> <s>  The rebels  see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against President  Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and  warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes. </s> <s>  Kabila has turned Kindu into  a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in  eastern Congo. </s> <s>  The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. </s> <s>   There are unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan  are involved in defending Kindu. </s> <s>  Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda  _ former allies who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month  rebellion _ of sponsoring the new fighting. </s> <s>  Both countries say they  have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila  of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. </s> <s>   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting  Kabila. </s> <s>  The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive  in the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-August. </s> <s>   The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised  to overrun the rest of the town. </s> <s>  Under a scorching sun, the column  of rebel reinforcements heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned  roadside hamlets. </s> <s>  The silence of their march was interrupted only  by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging  around the soldiers' necks. </s> <s>  Soldiers walked by empty huts made of  mud and palm leaves. </s> <s>  Some rested in the shade of the umbrella-shaped  acacia trees. </s> <s>  The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over  the chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards the path to Kindu. </s> <s>   There was no immediate comment on the latest developments from the  government in Kinshasa, which claimed earlier in the week it was in  control of the tarmac bridge. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Rebels surround airfield, shoot down passenger jet; situation uncertain. </s> </p> </d>
