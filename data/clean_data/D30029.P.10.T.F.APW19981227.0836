article= <d> <p> <s>  Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart  race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts  missing. </s> <s>  The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post  Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state  town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination  Center (AusSAR) in Canberra. </s> <s>  One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was  found mid-morning Monday and was making its way towards Eden on the  New South Wales coast, an AusSAR spokesman said. </s> <s>  The nine crew on  board were thought to be safe and the vessel was sailing unassisted. </s> <s>   The spokesman said no word had been received on the fate of the Winston  Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday  night. </s> <s>  As of mid-morning Monday, he had been in the water for 15 hours. </s> <s>   The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait  when it overturned. </s> <s>  The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision  and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS  Newcastle was on its way to the area. </s> <s>  Rescuers in more than 30 search  aircraft were similarly unsure of the whereabouts and condition of  Solo Globe and its crew. </s> <s>  Seven others on board the Business Post Naiad  were put aboard a helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, the  center said. </s> <s>  The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how  they died or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen. </s> <s>   There were unconfirmed reports that one of the dead sailors was British. </s> <s>   With winds gusting to 80 knots and seas swelling to 10 meters (35  feet), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the three  missing yachts. </s> <s>  Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known  how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water. </s> <s>  It's  supposition, Campbell said. </s> <s>  We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2  hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe  conditions. </s> <s>  A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard  when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. </s> <s>   John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40 minutes  and had hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable  Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell. </s> <s>  Despite  the conditions, Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would  be called off. </s> <s>  It does say in the instructions that it is the sole  responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues  in the race or retires, he said. </s> <s>  The Australian Maritime Safety  Authority (AMSA) alerted all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds  and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. </s> <s>  A total  of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile)  race. </s> <s>  Many lost their masts or have injured crew. </s> <s>  The American maxi  Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella. </s> <s>  Although  the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still  well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds,  set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Yacht B-52 found. </s> <s>  Solo Globe and Winston Churchill still missing. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
