article= <d> <p> <s>  In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon  Valley. </s> <s>  The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity  for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp. </s> <s> 's firm grip on the  personal computer software business. </s> <s>  Leading the challenge was Netscape  Communications Corp. </s> <s> , whose software for browsing the World Wide Web  had ignited the Internet boom. </s> <s>  Netscape chairman James Clark spoke  boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. </s> <s>  He borrowed imagery from the  movie Star Wars, referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and  Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. </s> <s>  Microsoft answered with  a vengeance. </s> <s>  It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing  browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it. </s> <s>  It  prodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser, folded  the browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and  gave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to cut off their  air supply, as a senior Microsoft executive described it. </s> <s>  But not  only competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. </s> <s>   Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors  who finance new ventures have all collided with it. </s> <s>  A close look at  Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business  offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to  influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. </s> <s>   Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought  by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to trial  this month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _ and violated  antitrust laws. </s> <s>  Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported  details about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide  a more complete picture of Microsoft in action. </s> <s>  _ When Compaq Computer  Corp. </s> <s>  considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's  on its personal computers, Microsoft threatened to stop selling its  Windows operating system to Compaq. </s> <s>  The company quickly changed its  mind. </s> <s>  _ After Spyglass Inc. </s> <s>  began supplying Microsoft with its early  browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its  browser free. </s> <s>  The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner Spyglass. </s> <s>   The company lost most of its revenues almost overnight, as the technology,  which it had also been licensing to companies besides Microsoft, suddenly  became available free. </s> <s>  _ When America Online Inc. </s> <s> , which competes  fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions,  went shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that  was too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser  as the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give  America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal  computers using Windows. </s> <s>  _ When Intel Corp. </s> <s>  began developing its own  Internet software, Microsoft complained. </s> <s>  Intel, the leading maker  of the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most  personal computers running Windows, pulled back. </s> <s>  The chip maker decided  that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft took priority. </s> <s>   _ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly  every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately  with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's  plans. </s> <s>  The goal, one venture investor observed, was to stay out  of the way of the steamroller. </s> <s>  Microsoft adamantly denies that it  has broken any laws in these or similar situations. </s> <s>  The company plays  the game of business hard, and its executives acknowledge that without  apology. </s> <s>  Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be  irritated occasionally. </s> <s>  But the company insists its actions are guided  by its main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively  and conveniently to the millions of people who use its software. </s> <s>  Most  people in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world  means routinely making accommodations to it. </s> <s>  Microsoft's power emanates  from its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating  systems, the master control programs that run computers. </s> <s>  Because  it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the essential utility of  the information age, said James Moore, president of Geopartners  Research Inc. </s> <s> , a technology consulting firm. </s> <s>  It acts as a kind of  gatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation, sitting there  and deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down. </s> <s>  For  months, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off, circling each  other warily. </s> <s>  But the event that would define them as unflinching  rivals was a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference  room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. </s> <s>  That meeting,  according to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft,  was the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled  railroad cars that inspired passage of the nation's antitrust laws  a century ago. </s> <s>  On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal  offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion  pact that Netscape rejected. </s> <s>  Microsoft replies that the prosecutors  are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and  that the company has never tried to divide the browser market. </s> <s>  Bill  Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend  the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the  Microsoft team. </s> <s>  Two people who did attend that June meeting have been  named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape  president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager  of new technology. </s> <s>  In the trial, the government will contend that  Microsoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according  to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation. </s> <s>  Relying  heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president  Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are  expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements,  both incentives and requirements. </s> <s>  Microsoft, according to the people  questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15  to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune  Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run  better on Windows. </s> <s>  In return, the people say, Netscape would give  Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft,  give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts  and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating  system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995  meeting. </s> <s>  And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied  it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business  negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows  application program interfaces, or APIs, the links that enable  other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating  system. </s> <s>  By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have  that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft  fiercely denies making. </s> <s>  Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive,  told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was  the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business. </s> <s>   Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's  money and its endorsement. </s> <s>  Netscape would have also been free to sell  its browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on  other operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful  system used mainly in corporations and research labs. </s> <s>  But if we  had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best  we could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $100  million or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft, said Clark,  a former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon  Graphics Inc. </s> <s> , a computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape. </s> <s>   We didn't start Netscape for that. </s> <s>  For any company, a meeting  with Microsoft is often a charged affair. </s> <s>  Every computing device from  keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to  browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system. </s> <s>   This is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but  it also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper. </s> <s>  And  since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond  the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position  of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against  it. </s> <s>  And in the software industry, where every program is rendered  in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition  and cooperation are often blurred. </s> <s>  The talk about that line at the  Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating  system _ the platform, in computer terms _ and the application  programs, sometimes called solutions, that run on top of the operating  system. </s> <s>  The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris  Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, admitted that  Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete. </s> <s>   Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly  of the company's clarifying its position. </s> <s>  If Netscape stayed on the  applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies  could be partners, Microsoft said. </s> <s>  But if Netscape tried to become  a player in the platform space, they would compete. </s> <s>  Microsoft released  portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the  government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context. </s> <s>  Q. Do  you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of  Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence  Netscape not to compete? </s> <s>  A. Absolutely. </s> <s>  But again, persuade in the  sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have  a great business relationship together. </s> <s>  Later in the deposition, a  Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft  executives intended to suggest that there would be any consequences  to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform  direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction. </s> <s>   Jones replied: The conversation was something like the following:  `We're in the platform business. </s> <s>  We're going to invest heavily in  this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies. </s> <s>   That's a done deal. </s> <s> ' And we're asking them: `What is your business? </s> <s>   Is your business platforms or solutions? </s> <s>  If it's platforms, we're  in the platforms business. </s> <s>  We're competing. </s> <s> ' Microsoft portrays  such comments as innocuous statements of fact. </s> <s>  But to Netscape, the  same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat. </s> <s>  This is  because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an  alternative platform to the Windows operating system. </s> <s>  The browser,  sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as  the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming  for starting other software applications. </s> <s>  In addition, Netscape's  browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running  Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems  Inc. </s> <s> , a Microsoft rival. </s> <s>  In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform  could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. </s> <s>   Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to  relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath  the browser. </s> <s>  By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape  as a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown  jewel. </s> <s>  On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, The Internet Tidal  Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' on the Internet is  Netscape. </s> <s>  Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing  them to determine which network extensions will catch on. Netscape's  strategy, Gates wrote, was to move the key API into the browser  to commoditize the underlying operating system. </s> <s>  THE BROADER INQUIRY:  GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states  have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding  evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. </s> <s>  and other  companies to squelch competition. </s> <s>  They say that like the Netscape  meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft,  which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors  and partners. </s> <s>  One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend,  was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development  of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with  Netscape. </s> <s>  Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips  that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run  the Windows operating system. </s> <s>  Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft  are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred  to as a single, powerful entity, Wintel. </s> <s>  But Intel also employs  hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs  in Hillsboro, Ore. </s> <s>  And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they  have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace  at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal  computer industry, which they dominate together. </s> <s>  Federal and state  investigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work  being done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in  no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif. </s> <s> ,  headquarters on Aug. </s> <s>  2, 1995. </s> <s>  The contentious session was attended  by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and  Intel chairman Andrew Grove. </s> <s>  An internal Intel memo stated that Gates  made vague threats about supporting Intel's competitors and that  he was livid about Intel's investments in the Internet and wanted  them stopped. </s> <s>  Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and  Internet software development. </s> <s>  Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president  who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a  witness for the government. </s> <s>  Microsoft replies that the government's  accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful  distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and  witnesses. </s> <s>  The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter  failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely  meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will  work well with Windows. </s> <s>  Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on  to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology  or a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape. </s> <s>   In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser  market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps. </s> <s>   To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month  and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, Competing  on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,  which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape  executives. </s> <s>  The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape. </s> <s>   But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard  Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. </s> <s>  Microsoft's  take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation  from competitors, the government and even customers, Yoffie said. </s> <s>   Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added,  I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did  without crossing the line as much as it did. </s> <s>  THE SPYGLASS LINK:  REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20  Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the  company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. </s> <s>  The subject was the Internet  and how it might revolutionize the computer software business. </s> <s>  Few  concrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist  that a direction was set. </s> <s>  Our vision from the outset was to unite  the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet, said Steven  Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting. </s> <s>  Yet Microsoft  badly trailed Netscape in the browser field. </s> <s>  To hasten its entry,  Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. </s> <s>   of Naperville, Ill. </s> <s>  The first meeting between the two companies was  initiated by Spyglass in April 1994. </s> <s>  At the time, it was a tiny company  and eager to do a deal with Microsoft. </s> <s>  Spyglass was selected as the  commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National  Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. </s> <s>  In the summer  of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of  Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. </s> <s>  The two men talked  in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class  passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going  to take Microsoft head-on. </s> <s>  At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking  to himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from  me. </s> <s>  Today, he noted: Remember, we were a company with a couple  dozen people and almost no money in the bank. </s> <s>  Netscape had Jim Clark,  with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing  from Silicon Valley. </s> <s>  Netscape had a very different agenda. </s> <s>  By July  1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology,  Colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement  the following December. </s> <s>  Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him  that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating  system, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise. </s> <s>  Microsoft  was initially hoping to charge for the browser, Colbeth said. </s> <s>  But  on Dec. </s> <s>  7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply  integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away. </s> <s>  The announcement  caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. </s> <s>  At the time, Spyglass  had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and  Digital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing  revenue stream of about $20 million a year. </s> <s>  As a result of Microsoft's  move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller  Internet software companies went out of business and big customers  shifted to Microsoft's free browser. </s> <s>  Spyglass slashed its payroll  and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace  its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually. </s> <s>  Whenever  you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can  someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put  you out of that business, Colbeth said. </s> <s>  THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY  SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market  continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though  its browser was free. </s> <s>  Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed  that Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader. </s> <s>  In April 1996,  Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the  Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer,  according to Zona Research. </s> <s>  So the biggest personal computer maker,  Compaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser  instead of Microsoft's. </s> <s>  But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and  Compaq had no choice but to give in. </s> <s>  In June 1996, Compaq wanted not  only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but  also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was  delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95. </s> <s>  Microsoft informed  Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would  lose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director  of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators. </s> <s>  The  ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed,  Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement. </s> <s>  Faced with being  denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course  and kept the Internet Explorer icon. </s> <s>  Microsoft asserts that Windows  and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone  defines what is in the product. </s> <s>  Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft  adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies. </s> <s>   While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily  hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer,  Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that to take  one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft  as an arrogant company is unfair. </s> <s>  Noting that a Compaq executive  is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, We are totally dependent  on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq. </s> <s>  At Netscape,  however, the Compaq episode was a watershed. </s> <s>  That was the singular  act that got me going to the Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. </s> <s>   Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to  buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product,  the Windows operating system, as an illegal act and absolute proof  that Microsoft was a monopolist. </s> <s>  After investigating the incident,  the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft  was illegally tying the sale of one product to another. </s> <s>  Microsoft  replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating  system. </s> <s>  And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows  and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated,  as they are now in Windows 98. </s> <s>  Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no  product-tying violation of antitrust laws. </s> <s>  In a separate case, a federal  appeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the  company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and  declare it a single product. </s> <s>  But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted  to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most  industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different  software programs. </s> <s>  It took a long time for the integration strategy  to play out, said a former senior Microsoft researcher. </s> <s>  Back then,  integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows. </s> <s>  THE `BALANCING  ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen  Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as a delicate balancing act. </s> <s>   That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of  1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured  place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. </s> <s>  To gain  access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed  to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online  subscribers, who now number more than 13 million. </s> <s>  Yet throughout 1995,  as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant  improvement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the  door of the Justice Department. </s> <s>  His complaint was that Microsoft was  going to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct  competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of  Windows 95, which was introduced in August. </s> <s>  This bundling tactic of  using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network,  or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young  but fast-growing online business. </s> <s>  The Justice Department listened  and investigated. </s> <s>  But ultimately, the government decided against taking  any action. </s> <s>  At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft  was both feared and loathed at the time. </s> <s>  America Online had a designated  Microsoft watcher, a young M.B. </s> <s> A. </s> <s>  who tracked its adversary's  every move. </s> <s>  Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture  of Gates. </s> <s>  Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words  THE ENEMY. </s> <s>  Though America Online was the clear leader in the online  services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault  by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. </s> <s>  When he had visited  the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled,  Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could  buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business  on his own and bury you. </s> <s>  A threat or merely a statement of the  facts? </s> <s>  A bit of both, Case said recently. </s> <s>  But he was mainly  articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood. </s> <s>   Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to  cooperate. </s> <s>  With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide  Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve,  had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own  services. </s> <s>  America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with  the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape  or Microsoft. </s> <s>  For both software companies, a deal with America Online,  which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge  in browser use and market share. </s> <s>  Netscape seemed the natural partner  for America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals. </s> <s>  On  March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology,  but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. </s> <s>   The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with  Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser  America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked  for Netscape's Navigator. </s> <s>  To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give  America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely  the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had  asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. </s> <s>  After we agreed  to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled  on the Windows desktop, Case said. </s> <s>  It was an example of Microsoft's  pragmatic side. </s> <s>  The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate  goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay  software business. </s> <s>  As a result, its new online service, MSN, would  have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival,  America Online. </s> <s>  It was Bill's decision, said former MSN general  manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. </s> <s>  He sent me e-mail  on it. </s> <s>  He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. </s> <s>  I disagreed  with him. </s> <s>  To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different  view of the likely impact on MSN. </s> <s>  He told senior vice president Brad  Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would  amount to putting a bullet through MSN's head, according to a  deposition taken by the Justice Department. </s> <s>  In the antitrust suit,  the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft  used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser  war against Netscape. </s> <s>  David Colburn, a senior vice president of America  Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is  a witness for the government. </s> <s>  Today, Microsoft has overhauled its  Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest  Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing  and news. </s> <s>  And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search  features, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN. </s> <s> com. </s> <s>  I still  regard Microsoft as a primary threat, Case observed. </s> <s>  Microsoft  has a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no  reason to think it won't in this business as well. </s> <s>  We will always  be in Microsoft's cross hairs. </s> <s>  THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER  At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is  one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. </s> <s>   Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson  learned, observed Clark, the Netscape chairman. </s> <s>  Silicon Valley's  venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's  high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days. </s> <s>   Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper. </s> <s>  For while competing directly  with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an  engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. </s> <s>   And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship  with Microsoft. </s> <s>  For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft  entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which  has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising  technology and people. </s> <s>  Microsoft understands start-up innovation  and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech  company, said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners,  a venture capital firm. </s> <s>  As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be  seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes  the business environment, like a weather front. </s> <s>  Microsoft is incredibly  pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates,  a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. </s> <s>  At the board meetings  of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always  come up, he said: One is the price of the company's stock, and the  other is what Microsoft is going to do. </s> <s>  In the last few years, Microsoft  has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior  Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists. </s> <s>  The meetings  are part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations  with Silicon Valley. </s> <s>  We work hard to provide clarity about where  we're going and where we're not going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's  chief financial officer. </s> <s>  Last year's conference took place in October  at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the  Wall Street of high-tech venture investing. </s> <s>  Maffei led a team of five  Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists,  one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the  minds of many of his peers: How do I invest in a company that stays  out of the way of the steamroller? </s> <s>  Maffei, recalled one person who  attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses  that Microsoft was likely to avoid. </s> <s>  His list included specialized  software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided  design and others. </s> <s>  But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry  appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms  that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system. </s> <s>   At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture  Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems  and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  and Byers, and said quietly, I guess that leaves us washing machines  and toasters. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Microsoft, Netscape, Internet, antitrust, AOL, Spyglass, Windows, Gates. </s> </p> </d>
