article= <d> <p> <s>  The raw passions were such that the House Democrats did not to hesitate  to bellow You resign! </s> <s>  You resign! </s> <s>  at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston  when he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit  the White House in the face of certain impeachment. </s> <s>  Shockingly, stunningly,  Livingston did just that. </s> <s>  He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as  if flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering  before his eyes in the debating chamber. </s> <s>  In his one and only strategem  in leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck  Congress like a verbal bomb. </s> <s>  Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized  upon the instant. </s> <s>  They had to stand, almost staggering to their feet,  to join the Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston  and his undeniable self-sacrifice. </s> <s>  As they stood, the Democrats sensed  Livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his  defenders. </s> <s>  For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate,  Livingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public  to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political  leader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city. </s> <s>   I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,  Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment  debate and the nation watching beyond. </s> <s>  Livingston walked off the floor  like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding  the leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty,  Newt Gingrich. </s> <s>  In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a  police officer: Livingston just resigned! </s> <s>  What? </s> <s>  What? </s> <s>  came  the reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement  would be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. </s> <s>   Just so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after  their long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings. </s> <s>  It  is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism! </s> <s>  declared Rep. </s> <s>   Jerrold Nadler, D-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , a leading presidential defender trying to  rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign  any more than President Clinton should quit under fire. </s> <s>  But the Republicans  were surging to the fore on the strength of Livingston's announcement,  fighting tears as they rose to salute him as the ultimate political  role model in the grueling impeachment process as it roared into the  final minutes of debate. </s> <s>  For some it is no longer good enough to  make a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequences  of that mistake, said Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hands  shaking, his eyes tearing as he addressed the House and sought to  drive the example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue. </s> <s>   He understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty, integrity  and the truth, said DeLay arguing that in one swift blow, Livingston  had demonstrated himself to have been a far better speaker than Clinton  has been a president. </s> <s>  With something of the political elan the president  showed in initiating the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed,  House Republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a rocket's  red glare of their own. </s> <s>  I have hurt you all deeply and beg your  forgiveness, Livingston told the House, the nation and his family  as he announced retreat. </s> <s>  Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed  the man as Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president:  Sir, you have done great damage to this nation over the past year. </s> <s>   Presidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then came  the shouts of You resign! </s> <s>  You resign! </s> <s>  And as Livingston closed  the circle on his career, he stunned the place into a collective breath  of disbelief and somehow almost threatened to reduce the dark historic  issue before the House _ the impeachment of the president _ into a  matter of anticlimax. </s> <s>  They must not succeed, David Bonior, the  Democratic whip said of the Republicans as he was given the task of  refocusing the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure  of the speaker. </s> <s>  We are here to debate impeachment and should not  be distracted from that, he declared. </s> <s>  The only way we can stop  this vicious cycle, Bonior cried out from the floor, is if we  refuse to give into it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. </s> <s>   But the House was still reeling through the frenzied day as the fateful  vote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked  about the capital city like a flame in a forest. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Speaker-elect Livingston's Resignation During Clinton Debate Stuns House. </s> </p> </d>
