article= <d> <p> <s>  In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. </s> <s>  President Clinton met  Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to  put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. </s> <s>  After getting  together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met  at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later. </s> <s>  The  president was sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding  in Washington. </s> <s>  At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday,  Netanyahu said he hoped the president's visit would contribute to  true peace. </s> <s>  Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of  ignoring commitments in peace accords. </s> <s>  Clinton is to meet with Palestinian  leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. </s> <s>  Thousands of police  were deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. </s> <s>  At the hotel  where Clinton is staying, 500 policemen were posted to guard the president  and his 600-member delegation. </s> <s>  Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their  daughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>  Clinton toured  a school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while  Chelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. </s> <s>   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a picture-taking  session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel has  not left the Wye River agreement. </s> <s>  We will not give up on the  land-for-security accord, Sharon said. </s> <s>  But, he added, it should  be based on mutual reciprocity. </s> <s>  About two hours before Air Force  One landed Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approved  a fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. </s> <s>  The full House will  vote on the impeachment articles next week. </s> <s>  Israeli government spokesman  Moshe Fogel was asked Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would  turn on the question of revoking the Palestinian Liberation Organization's  founding charter. </s> <s>  President Clinton played a very important role  in the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going  to be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness  on the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,  Fogel said. </s> <s>  There was no letup in violence Sunday. </s> <s>  Palestinian stone  throwers clashed with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student  was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. </s> <s>  In his remarks  at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said the peace  process is in danger. </s> <s>  Mr. President, Netanyahu said, speaking  in Hebrew, The truth has to be told. </s> <s>  In recent weeks the Palestinians  again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their  commitments. </s> <s>  We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo  fulfillment of those commitments. </s> <s>  Netanyahu, who is facing political  turmoil in his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept  a phony peace on paper which is not honored in practice. </s> <s>  Since  Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security  agreement has hit one snag after another. </s> <s>  Israel froze implementation  of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and  inciting violent street protests. </s> <s>  Clinton said the United States shares  Israel's concerns about security. </s> <s>  Peace is not simply an option  among many but the only choice that can avert still more years of  bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow, he said. </s> <s>  That is why I'm here. </s> <s>   He said both sides now must face the challenge of implementing Wye. </s> <s>   Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. </s> <s>  The Israeli  leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament prepares  for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. </s> <s>  His coalition began to  weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum Oct. </s> <s>  23  agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be met  by Palestinian security measures. </s> <s>  Netanyahu has said there would be  no further troop withdrawals until West Bank rioting and violence  ends. </s> <s>  Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement  over procedures for revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling  for Israel's destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners  held in Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish  state. </s> <s>  On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza  Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit. </s> <s>   Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National  Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood. </s> <s>   It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state, Ziyad  Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council, said in  an interview Sunday. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Mid-east Wye Accord off-track
