article= <d> <p> <s>  A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. </s> <s>  Robert  Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him  running against Newt Gingrich as speaker. </s> <s>  But Gingrich's counter-campaign  has given some members pause about ousting him. </s> <s>  At the same time,  a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not  vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because  of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in  knots for months. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. </s> <s> , said: I personally  have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker  in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the  same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock  the vote. </s> <s>  Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections,  when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House. </s> <s>  They  blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. </s> <s>  But many were already  angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear  message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget  process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted  Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive  amounts of spending for local projects. </s> <s>  House Republicans are to meet  Nov. </s> <s>  18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. </s> <s>  Whoever wins the  Republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full  House in January. </s> <s>  Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could  be denied re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least  five others refuse to vote for him. </s> <s>  Because the Republicans now control  the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich  to deny him a majority. </s> <s>  With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect  looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the  good of the party, Republican officials said. </s> <s>  The officials said that  Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but  also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure  with the speaker over the budget process. </s> <s>  Several Republicans said  that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker,  and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for  votes. </s> <s>  Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich,  but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce  his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined  if he could win. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Peter King, R-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , was one of several members  who spoke with Livingston on Thursday. </s> <s>  He told me he's making a  number of phone calls, that he's gotten a very positive response about  running for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours,  King said. </s> <s>  He won't do it till he has his ducks in a row, and right  now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker, said an aide  to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line  between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement  to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party. </s> <s>  Many Republicans  immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday. </s> <s>  Talk  quickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose Gingrich  and his lieutenants. </s> <s>  The list of possible candidates for leadership  positions included Rep. </s> <s> e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with  Livingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich, Republican officials  said, speaking on the condition that their names not be reported. </s> <s>   Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted to  run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey,  the majority leader. </s> <s>  But, these officials said that if Livingston  did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead. </s> <s>   Other names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts. </s> <s>  They included  Reps. </s> <s>  David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington  as conference chairman. </s> <s>  Added to the mix on Thursday was the name  of Rep. </s> <s>  Christopher Cox, a California conservative. </s> <s>  As a sign of the  uncertainty prevailing among House members on Thursday, Rep. </s> <s>  Henry  Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House's  most venerable members, rebuffed a chance to endorse Gingrich as speaker. </s> <s>   Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's losses  Tuesday. </s> <s>  Leadership takes credit when things go right, he said. </s> <s>   They ought to take the blame when things go wrong. </s> <s>  Asked if Gingrich  should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, but that  remains to be seen. </s> <s>  The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday  as anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal  political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in toppling  Gingrich and whether he should succeed. </s> <s>  While many support him as  a veteran who understands the House and has shown shrewd political  skills in managing the massive federal budget, others are reviving  images of the Louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name  during the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward  arm-flailing in heated moments. </s> <s>  One conservative leader said that  he and his allies had reservations about Livingston because he was  obsessed about trying to keep social issues out of the budget  process. </s> <s>  The budget, he said, has been a vehicle for conservatives  over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and  other things you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential  veto. </s> <s>  If Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying  of the real conservatives in Congress. </s> <s>  Some moderates said they  were prepared to support him. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Marge Roukema, R-N. </s> <s> J. </s> <s> , said, I  would be amenable to Livingston. </s> <s>  Still, she cautioned, I'm not  after Newt. </s> <s>  But it's wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our  options. </s> <s>  Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. </s> <s>  W.J. </s> <s>  (Billy) Tauzin, R-La. </s> <s> ,  said that his boss was emblematic of the confusion among the broad  base of House Republicans. </s> <s>  Billy has been loyal to both Speaker  Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal to them, but he also  wants to hear what they have to say before committing to them in the  next election, Johnson said. </s> <s>  Everyone is asking the same question:  Can we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning  the leadership? </s> <s>  Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter  what was based on Gingrich's track record of one failed strategy  after another, including the impeachment process and the pork-laden  budget. </s> <s>  With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to  show members that he is responsive to their concerns. </s> <s>  After an election  night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as  they lost seats, the next day he took responsibility for the losses. </s> <s>   In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede  control over the party's congressional campaign committee, allowing  the whole House to select its members. </s> <s>  Gingrich is also making strong  personal appeals to Republicans. </s> <s>  Said one top House aide: He'll  get support. </s> <s>  How much? </s> <s>  Only his own vote-counters know. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Election of Gingrich as House Speaker in doubt as small group opposes him. </s>
