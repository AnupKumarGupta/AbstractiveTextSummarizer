article= <d> <p> <s>  In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane. </s> <s>  Two thugs,  armed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful  figure, then slipped away into the night. </s> <s>  Police vowed to catch them  and politicians expressed outrage. </s> <s>  Usually, that would be the end  of the story. </s> <s>  This time, though, the figure shot was one of the most  prominent and popular women in Russian politics, a prospective presidential  candidate with friends in the highest reaches of the Kremlin. </s> <s>  As outrage  mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova  was not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might  turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. </s> <s>  This is impossible  to tolerate any longer, said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko,  another reform-oriented party. </s> <s>  We must stop feeling powerless before  the increasingly cheeky scum. </s> <s>  We cannot go on living as though everything  is running as usual. </s> <s>  Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a  leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking  up the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young  aide Friday evening. </s> <s>  A team of assailants _ police believe it was  a man and a woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire. </s> <s>  Starovoitova,  shot three times in the head, collapsed and died instantly, authorities  said. </s> <s>  The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded,  but managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness. </s> <s>   Police have recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can provide  a description of the killers. </s> <s>  He had regained consciousness but still  could not speak Sunday. </s> <s>  Although it was still not clear who killed  Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract  hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. </s> <s>  Most of the  killings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped  the government and the economy. </s> <s>  Until now, the most notorious of the  killings was that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who  was shot outside his Moscow home in 1995. </s> <s>  But there have been hundreds  of others. </s> <s>  St. Petersburg has been especially plagued. </s> <s>  Last year,  the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a central St. Petersburg  street. </s> <s>  In the past two months alone, hitmen have claimed the lives  of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent  banker. </s> <s>  So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President  Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that  his Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _  had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent  businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. </s> <s>   There is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination  of Berezovsky. </s> <s>  But Yeltsin's order was the equivalent of U.S. </s> <s>  President  Bill Clinton ordering an investigation into whether the FBI was plotting  to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. </s> <s>  Yet, as remarkable as that  news was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. </s> <s>   Television news since her death has carried reports of little else. </s> <s>   Reaction has poured in from virtually every important figure in the  country, and from surrounding nations. </s> <s>  Yeltsin, calling her my comrade,  declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her  death. </s> <s>  There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death,  the sense that a line had been crossed. </s> <s>  Perhaps it was because she  was a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or  perhaps because people are simply fed up. </s> <s>  But, in more characteristic  fashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing. </s> <s>   Colleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence  _ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament,  were the most likely culprits in her death. </s> <s>  Historian Dmitry Likachyov,  one of the nation's most revered and trusted figures, said her killing  seemed to signal the outburst of a new Red Terror. </s> <s>  By late Saturday,  the name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin  called a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist  speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. </s> <s>   Seleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her death. </s> <s>   But, he added, I would not like the deputies who sat on the  same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s>  to turn  this into a political show. </s> <s>  It is too early to know where the recriminations  and political maneuvering will lead. </s> <s>  For now, the only thing certain  is the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian  martyrs. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Galina Starovoitova's Murder May Be A Watershed Event in Russian Politics. </s> </p> </d>
