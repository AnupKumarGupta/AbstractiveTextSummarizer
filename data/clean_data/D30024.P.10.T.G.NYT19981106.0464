article= <d> <p> <s>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution  of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President  Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned  on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections. </s> <s>   Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich  announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans  that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. </s> <s>  18 vote  and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. </s> <s>   This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in  the system, Gingrich said, according to a party aide who listened  to one of the calls. </s> <s>  Gingrich's resignation was a stunning reversal  for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians  in America. </s> <s>  He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one Democratic  speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style through Tuesday's  elections with last-minute commercials reminding voters of the Clinton  scandal. </s> <s>  His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday  night. </s> <s>  In his second conference call, according to several people  who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall. </s> <s>   Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control  of Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter critics in the  last two years of his tumultuous speakership. </s> <s>  Friday night he called  them cannibals who had blackmailed him into quitting. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Michael  P. Forbes, R-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , said: Newt said all those who had marginalized  the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism. </s> <s>  He said, `Refer to  the clips. </s> <s> ' He's blaming others. </s> <s>  Another Republican described the  conference call this way: He started off very statesmanlike, but  then you could see the anger building. </s> <s>  When someone asked him why  he was leaving, he said, `A handful of members have blackmailed the  conference. </s> <s> ' He said, `They're hateful. </s> <s> ' And he said, `They're cannibals. </s> <s> '  Gingrich announced his move just hours after Rep. </s> <s>  Robert L. Livingston  of Louisiana announced he was running for speaker, putting himself  forward as a pragmatist and a manager. </s> <s>  After the Gingrich calls, Rep. </s> <s>   Bill Archer of Texas announced he was considering his own run for  speaker. </s> <s>  Livingston and Archer are chairmen of the two most powerful  committees in the House. </s> <s>  In a statement Gingrich said, The Republican  conference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward. </s> <s>   He said he hoped his colleagues would pick a successor who can both  reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. </s> <s>   Referring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning from  Congress because Marianne and I are tired. </s> <s>  We need time off to get  to know each other again. </s> <s>  He also acknowledged his own knack for  bringing negative attention to himself and his party. </s> <s>  If I stay,  he told his colleagues Friday night, my controversial nature would  overshadow any successes we might have, an understatement to those  who recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown  of the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the  back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton. </s> <s>  According  to another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of his resignation:  There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members. </s> <s>  So long  as I am around, I will always be a target in the news media, which  would mean we would never be able to get our message out. </s> <s>  Clinton  said: Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican  Party to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national  debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. </s> <s>  Despite  our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were able to  work together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's  strong support for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace  and prosperity in the world. </s> <s>  Many Republicans took the opportunity  to portray Gingrich as a visionary. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Sherwood Boehlert of New  York said that during the first conference call, there was shock  and surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for leading us  to the Promised Land. </s> <s>  His supporters said Gingrich had the votes  to win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted  by secret ballot. </s> <s>  But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority  meant every vote would be a battle. </s> <s>  Kenneth Duberstein, a former official  in the Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he had the votes  to be speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern. </s> <s>  He said  that because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not have  been able to implement his plans. </s> <s>  In an unusually biting reaction,  Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped  that Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that  he had fostered. </s> <s>  I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker  will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was  wrought on this institution over the last four years, Gephardt said. </s> <s>   House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set  off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had  been anticipated. </s> <s>  There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne  who will test the waters, said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich  for re-election as speaker. </s> <s>  There won't be any shortage of candidates. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Combative Newt resigns as Speaker and Congressman; end of GOP "revolution"? </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
