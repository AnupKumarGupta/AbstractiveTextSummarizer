article= <d> <p> <s>  In little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this  businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting  of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. </s> <s>  They could hardly  be meeting in a more provocative place. </s> <s>  On Sept. </s> <s>  1, Malaysia discontinued  trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls  on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly  on investment from overseas. </s> <s>  In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister,  Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy  that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion. </s> <s>   Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy-  makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would  retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out  when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise. </s> <s>  Now, though,  Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate  that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund  economy. </s> <s>  Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and  there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again. </s> <s>   It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls,  the economy has improved, said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director  of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research  organization here that helped draft the policies. </s> <s>  But we want to  see whether this is strongly sustainable. </s> <s>  Critics said it was predictable  that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. </s> <s>   Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows  and currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able  to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. </s> <s>  Still, the  mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results  guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. </s> <s>  With  Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will  have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin  of Westerners. </s> <s>  Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,  said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. </s> <s>  There is  no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to  muzzle him, he added, referring to President Jiang of China. </s> <s>  Policy-makers  in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit  is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the  region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it. </s> <s>  So far, Indonesian  officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised  by the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity  and open markets. </s> <s>  But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy  for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency  measure. </s> <s>  Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention  that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial  system. </s> <s>  He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge  fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive  consequences. </s> <s>  The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in  Greenwich, Conn. </s> <s> , was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on  Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted  a flight of capital out of that country. </s> <s>  The LTCM fiasco really  provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,  Yusof said. </s> <s>  With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia  was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy. </s> <s>  In addition to  growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade  balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods. </s> <s>  Foreign investors  have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted  they would. </s> <s>  While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to  $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the  period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely. </s> <s>   For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming  one. </s> <s>  They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely  due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian  currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated  by Sept. </s> <s>  30. </s> <s>  The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in  September, despite several reductions in interest rates. </s> <s>  So the consumers  who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into  their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings  are depleted. </s> <s>  The argument was that by imposing capital controls,  you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the  supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch, said K.S. </s> <s>  Jomo,  a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here. </s> <s>   But that's not happening. </s> <s>  The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy,  Jomo and others said, is its timing. </s> <s>  With the Asian crisis more than  a year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has  already gone. </s> <s>  The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors  without even locking in the ones who used to be here. </s> <s>  There is a  case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls,  but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one, Jomo said. </s> <s>  In fact,  other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht,  have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency  and fixed the exchange rate at 3. </s> <s> 8 ringgit to the dollar. </s> <s>  Analysts  liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that  has come and gone. </s> <s>  More important, the capital controls are slowing  down much-needed corporate and banking reforms. </s> <s>  The government's rescue  of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going  ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually  scrap the much-criticized plan. </s> <s>  The rescue of politically connected  companies remains a tense issue here. </s> <s>  On Monday, during the trial  of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges  of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's  claim that he had approved the bailout. </s> <s>  Anwar's sensational trial  is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled  from politics. </s> <s>  Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with  his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he  dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls. </s> <s>  During boom  times, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner  language. </s> <s>  In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying  foreign currency traders are the cause of the currency turmoil,  adding: They spread it worldwide. </s> <s>  They precipitated the current  recession in every country. </s> <s>  But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has  stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia. </s> <s>  With  protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this  city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order  to soothe the country's agitated population. </s> <s>  Things will heat up  if the economy does not improve, said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor  of political science at the University of Malaya. </s> <s>  Then the whole  question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue. </s> <s>  In  that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in  two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Malaysia institutes sweeping monetary change before start of APEC meeting. </s>
