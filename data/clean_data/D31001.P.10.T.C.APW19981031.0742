article= <d> <p> <s>  President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National  Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds  with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South  Africa. </s> <s>  The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report  by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during  apartheid. </s> <s>  Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation,  the report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms  who fought apartheid. </s> <s>  As expected, the report called apartheid a crime  against humanity. </s> <s>  But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights  violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured  suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with  land mines and bombs. </s> <s>  Some suspected traitors were killed in the ANC's  camps abroad. </s> <s>  Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will  likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela  retires _ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated  all ANC members must do the same. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Mandela acknowledges human rights violations by African National Congress. </s> </p> </d>
