article= <d> <p> <s>  Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament  to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened  with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. </s> <s>  The address  to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by  the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old,  center-left alliance stands or falls. </s> <s>  Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist  Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support  over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting  1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European  common currency. </s> <s>  Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if  he lost the Communists' support. </s> <s>  I've always acted with coherence,  Prodi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  on the crisis. </s> <s>  I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do  political gymnastics. </s> <s>  The break with Prodi's government divided  Refoundation. </s> <s>  Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned  as party president Monday. </s> <s>  He said the party's desertion of Prodi  was wrong and dangerous, but at the same time promised to follow  the party line. </s> <s>  We are in a very complicated political crisis which  could lead to early elections, Cossutta told reporters Monday. </s> <s>  And  with the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the  right. </s> <s>  If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses,  he would offer his resignation. </s> <s>  Once he does that, it is up to Scalfaro  to decide what to do. </s> <s>  He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a  new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something  most analysts think unlikely. </s> <s>  Working in Prodi's favor is the fact  that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections,  including the Communist Refoundation. </s> <s>  There was speculation Prodi  would reopen negotiations that would win back the communists' grudging  support, as he has managed to do in the past. </s> <s>  Prodi's government has  held together this long in large part because of the widely shared  desire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of  Europe's common currency, the euro. </s> <s>  That happened earlier this year  _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. </s> <s>   Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. </s> <s>  He has outlasted  all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two back-to-back stints  from 1983 to 1987. </s> <s>  Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left  coalition, but the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority  in the lower house. </s> <s>  It has been a difficult ally from the outset. </s> <s>   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending  troops into Albania last year. </s> <s>  Prodi was even forced to resign a year  ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. </s> <s>  The  crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made steep  concessions and promised a 35-hour work week. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Prodi will go to Parliament to save government; Cossutta quit as party pres. </s> </p> </d>
