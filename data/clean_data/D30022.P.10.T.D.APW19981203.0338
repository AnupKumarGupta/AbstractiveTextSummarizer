article= <d> <p> <s>  China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested  this week are suspected of endangering national security _ the clearest  sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party. </s> <s>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws  were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state. </s> <s>   A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been  in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of inciting the  overthrow of the government, the Hong Kong-based Information Center  of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. </s> <s>  All three  men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures  under China's vague state security law. </s> <s>  The ruling Communist Party  has resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect  last year. </s> <s>  The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and  the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese  leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally  register the China Democracy Party in June. </s> <s>  Xu and Qin were suspected  of involvement in activities endangering state security and their  behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the  People's Republic of China, Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing. </s> <s>   Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charges  have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a step closer  to trial, the Information Center said. </s> <s>  Xu and Qin are influential  figures in the dissident community, having started their campaign  for change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. </s> <s>  Wang  was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. </s> <s>   Both have served time in prison. </s> <s>  Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of  it in solitary confinement. </s> <s>  Since dissidents began organizing and  trying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have  harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen members, but until  now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegations. </s> <s>   The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form  since it took power in 1949. </s> <s>  In Washington on Wednesday, White House  spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests  and said the dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental  human rights that all governments should protect. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  officials conveyed  their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged  that Xu and Qin be released immediately. </s> <s>  Zhu criticized the United  States for condemning the arrests, saying that no country, including  the United States, should interfere in China's internal affairs. </s> <s>   China in October signed a key U.N. </s> <s>  treaty on civil and political rights  that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association. </s> <s>   It was the 17th international human rights treaty China has signed. </s> <s>   Zhu told reporters there was absolutely no contradiction at all  between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the  two dissidents. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> PRC says Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin arrested for endangering national security. </s> </p> </d>
