article= <d> <p> <s>  House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal  health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving  an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights. </s> <s>   But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached  to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding  the Federal Election Commission. </s> <s>  That provision could scuttle the  spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the  Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate. </s> <s>   The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans,  which affect 1. </s> <s> 2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing  age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country _ birth  control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. </s> <s>   Currently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods. </s> <s>   The House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this  year. </s> <s>  But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval  and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion  on the matter. </s> <s>  The cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket  cost of health care for women. </s> <s>  And many male members of Congress seemed  persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost  all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency  drug. </s> <s>  Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills  before Oct. </s> <s>  9, when temporary financing of the government expires,  the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their  conference report on the $13. </s> <s> 4 billion bill for the Treasury Department  and Postal service. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Nita Lowey, D-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , who pushed the contraceptive  measure through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement as the first  major accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the Republicans  took control of Congress in 1994. </s> <s>  She said the negotiators had agreed  to include the measure because in an election year they did not want  to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting  a measure that had passed both the House and Senate. </s> <s>  But many Democrats  said the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen  as interfering with the independence of the Federal Election Commission. </s> <s>   That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven  federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general  counsel and staff director. </s> <s>  The provision is aimed at getting rid  of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated  the campaign finance practices of groups like the Christian Coalition. </s> <s>   The contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have  helped stall four spending bills. </s> <s>  The three other bills that are stalled  in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture  bill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and  Drug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like  RU-486, which induce abortions. </s> <s>  The foreign operations bill is also  stalled over whether to finance international family planning programs  that may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is  delayed because of a provision that would block access of minors to  contraception. </s> <s>  Addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives,  Helen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic  Bishops, said that the bill was bad policy. </s> <s>  She said contraception  had failed to stem the number of abortions, teen-age pregnancies or  out-of-wedlock births. </s> <s>  Public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic  for them, she conceded, but in terms of social policy, this is  a failure. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Thorny Federal Election Commission Provision Threatens Spending Bill. </s> </p> </d>
