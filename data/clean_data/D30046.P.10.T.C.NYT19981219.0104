article= <d> <p> <s>  The only thing certain now is uncertainty. </s> <s>  The smart money shouts  that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. </s> <s>  The smart  money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would  be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would  require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand  against him. </s> <s>  The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal  to end all this. </s> <s>  Maybe so. </s> <s>  But the smarter money whispers, Remember. </s> <s>   Remember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. </s> <s>  Henry Hyde, R-Ill. </s> <s> ,  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would never, ever,  treat impeachment as a partisan issue. </s> <s>  Wrong. </s> <s>  Remember that all the  pundits predicted Democratic losses in the midterm elections, and  when the opposite happened, they said impeachment was dead. </s> <s>  Twice  wrong. </s> <s>  And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down  a road it has never traveled before. </s> <s>  One other president, Andrew Johnson  of Tennessee, has been tried by the Senate, of course. </s> <s>  But that happened  in a different country _one with only 37 states, with primitive communications,  with a simple economy based largely on agriculture, with only minimal  commitments abroad. </s> <s>  In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington,  the inconceivable has become the commonplace. </s> <s>  The wholly unanticipated  announcement Saturday morning by Rep. </s> <s>  Robert Livingston, R-La. </s> <s> , that  he would not serve as speaker and would resign from Congress, following  his equally unanticipated disclosure on Thursday night of several  extramarital affairs, only deepened the capital's profound sense of  insecurity. </s> <s>  The deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears  unstoppable, at least for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming  resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise. </s> <s>   You've set before us an example, the leader of House Republican  majority, Rep. </s> <s>  Dick Armey of Texas, told Livingston Saturday. </s> <s>  The  example is that principle comes before power. </s> <s>  The Democrats made  the opposite point, arguing that the Livingston case showed how very  wrong it was to savage people for personal pecaddillos. </s> <s>  One transcendently  important thing remains the same: Although surrounded by judicial  trappings and presided over by the chief justice, trials of presidents  are political processes, with power residing in the hands of elective  politicians. </s> <s>  In addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence,  they can weigh considerations of party, the nation's future, their  own individual political well-being and almost anything else they  care to weigh in reaching a verdict. </s> <s>  The longer they took, the more  numerous the call for resignation would probably be. </s> <s>  Even before Saturday's  epochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest  New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought the president should  step down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large  majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings. </s> <s>  What lies  behind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the fear that Clinton,  and the country with him, would be incapacitated. </s> <s>  No one took Andrew  Johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote. </s> <s>   But Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a series  of comebacks, has already embarked on an effort to show that he can  do the nation's business. </s> <s>  Richard Nixon clawed his way back to respectability  after leaving the White House when no one thought he could; Clinton  intends to re-establish his authority while still in office. </s> <s>  He has  one great advantage: Two-thirds of the American public continues to  voice its approval of his political stewardship, whatever it thinks  of him as a man. </s> <s>  The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced  leverage, for a deal on censure. </s> <s>  Indeed, in as fine a piece of political  irony as one could ask for, he has already sought to enlist former  Sen. </s> <s>  Bob Dole, the Republican he defeated in 1996, as an emissary  to the Senate majority. </s> <s>  The numbers are not unpromising: with the  help of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats could end the trial at any  time and pass a censure resolution that the House would surely take  up. </s> <s>  There are enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers  to make that a plausible target. </s> <s>  But the Republican leader in the  Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who has made his unwillingness  to take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, is determined  to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement. </s> <s>  It is clear that Clinton's  reputation has been stained forever, no matter what the Senate does. </s> <s>   The spot will not out. </s> <s>  History will remember this man who so coveted  a glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth, not as the  Moses who pointed the way to the 21st century, but as the second president  ever to be impeached, if not as the first to be ousted. </s> <s>  That harsh  word, impeachment, will cling to his name as surely as Teapot  Dome clings to Harding's and Depression to Hoover's. </s> <s>  But he  is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche  that was shaken loose by the disclosure of Clinton's sexual relationship  with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. </s> <s>  The Republicans'  public support has shriveled to 40 percent in the new Times/CBS News  poll, its lowest level in 14 years, and it could go lower once the  fact of impeachment sinks in. </s> <s>  Journalists are seen by many as jackals,  indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they  may cause as long as they get the story, and none too concerned about  accuracy. </s> <s>  In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with  its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference  to important national and international issues, has fallen into disrepute  with ordinary Americans. </s> <s>  The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term  decline in political civility. </s> <s>  Republicans called Clinton a liar,  even as he was committing American pilots to the skies over Iraq,  and Democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching  or a political coup d'etat. </s> <s>  Bipartisanship may have been the biggest  victim of all. </s> <s>  Party lines on Saturday's rolls calls held as firm  as leg irons. </s> <s>  Almost all of the Republicans who opposed impeachment  did so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because  of special political circumstances _ the Democratic majority in Rep. </s> <s>   Constance Morella's district in the Maryland suburbs of Washington,  for example, and the gratitude of Rep. </s> <s>  Peter King, R-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , for Clinton's  peacemaking in Ireland. </s> <s>  It is hard to see who has emerged from it  with reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch  in the face of deception. </s> <s>  If some of the threats and dire predictions  uttered by House Democrats in recent days are to be taken at face  value, the nation is entering upon an Era of Bad Feelings, the polar  opposite of a second Era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the  1820s, that Clinton had hoped to preside over. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio,  compared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, executed for treason  in 1535 because of his religious beliefs. </s> <s>  He quoted More's words as  an admonition for today: What you have hunted me for is not my actions  but for the thoughts of my heart. </s> <s>  It is a long road you have opened. </s> <s>   God help the statesmen who walk your road. </s> <s>  But amidst all the loose  talk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember:  Things change with startling speed in modern American politics, and  the institutions of American government have proved extraordinarily  resilient. </s> <s>  President Nixon, it was almost universally agreed in 1974,  had weakened the American presidency for many decades to come. </s> <s>  Nobody  said that after eight years under Ronald Reagan, and that was only  15 years later. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Clinton impeachment uncertain as partisan politics prevail. </s> </p> </d>
