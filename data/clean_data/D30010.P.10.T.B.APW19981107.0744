article= <d> <p> <s>  A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel  would continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem,  including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector  of the city. </s> <s>  We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in  every part of Jerusalem, Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters  in Jerusalem, By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa. </s> <s>  Har Homa  is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab  east Jerusalem. </s> <s>  Groundbreaking at the site led to angry Palestinian  protests and a breakdown of peace talks in March 1997. </s> <s>  Netanyahu's  Cabinet delayed action on the new peace accord following Friday's  suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building  on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a  politically sensitive moment. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few  days despite the market bombing, a television report said Saturday. </s> <s>   The United States understands the delay by a day or two but expects  the agreement to be approved soon, Albright told Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, Channel Two reported. </s> <s>  The radical group  Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing  and vowed more attacks to try to block the new peace accord. </s> <s>  This  heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last,  the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations. </s> <s>  We refuse  any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy. </s> <s>   An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed  that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility  for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte  Carlo. </s> <s>  Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead bombers  had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists. </s> <s>  At least half  a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up since the bombing,  the sources said. </s> <s>  Palestinian political leaders said Israel should  not use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants  and wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse to stop the peace process. </s> <s>  One  of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight  attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets. </s> <s>  The Palestinians,  however, said the two bombers had come from Israeli-controlled areas  and that Israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility  for the attack. </s> <s>  The Israeli military said it could not confirm the  suicide bombers' identities and hometowns, but they were disclosed  by Palestinian security officials and also reported by Palestinian  media. </s> <s>  One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem,  and the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya,  outside the town of Jenin. </s> <s>  Both families held so-called mourning houses  on Saturday, but not actual funerals, since Israeli authorities still  have their bodies. </s> <s>  I didn't raise him to lose him like that, said  Mohammed Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar,  22. </s> <s>  I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son. </s> <s>  The family  of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been married for three  months to Zughayar's sister, Basma. </s> <s>  They met when she was visiting  her brother, who was in prison with Dahayneh, the family said. </s> <s>  At  the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the  site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no lives other  than those of the assailants were lost. </s> <s>  A ring of young men wearing  skullcaps joined hands and danced, and rabbis spoke of the miracle  that had saved those shopping in the market at the time of the attack. </s> <s>   Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous  phone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides now have agreed  that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Israel will continue building homes in Jerusalem, including in Arab sector. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
