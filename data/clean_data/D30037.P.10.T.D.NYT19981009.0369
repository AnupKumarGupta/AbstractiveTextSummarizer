article= <d> <p> <s>  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish  former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday  in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning  over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. </s> <s>  With his appointment,  Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West  Bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions  that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference  in the Washington area next week. </s> <s>  For months, Sharon, who is currently  the minister of national infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying  Israeli troops from more than an additional 9 percent of the West  Bank would be a national disaster. </s> <s>  In assuming the role of foreign  minister, however, he would be forced to abandon his public opposition  to Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the  Palestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord. </s> <s>  Sharon  will be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu has appointed  him to direct the final status talks with the Palestinians, which  would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. </s> <s>  Last week  Sharon told an Israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would  never shake the hand of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom  he has long disdained. </s> <s>  Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were  divided in their reactions, in similar ways. </s> <s>  Some professed to be  aghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation  minister, said they were willing to forget history if Sharon's  appointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal. </s> <s>   In Washington, White House and State Department officials pledged  to work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an  Israeli government are an internal affair. </s> <s>  Arik Sharon is the most  fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign  minister, Netanyahu said, using his nickname. </s> <s>  He brings with him  rich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that  he well knows both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits  of peace. </s> <s>  Sharon has never hidden his beliefs, he continued, and  his words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried  out if not its extent. </s> <s>  In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu has decided  on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent  of the West Bank land. </s> <s>  It was supposed to be in the Judean desert  near Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose a strategic  security risk. </s> <s>  Instead, it was decided on Thursday that the nature  reserve would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills, much closer  to existing Jewish settlements. </s> <s>  Many Israeli political observers believe  that Netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this  appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace  agreement. </s> <s>  Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign  ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians? </s> <s>  asked Uzi Benziman,  an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a  critical biography of Sharon. </s> <s>  It will be just the settlers and some  real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public  opinion. </s> <s>  So it's really quite an intelligent move, suggesting that  Netanyahu means business in trying to get an agreement. </s> <s>  But the  Palestinians took the news hard, and read it differently. </s> <s>  I think  it's a clear-cut message from Bibi, Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator  for the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. </s> <s>  I imagine  people will try to explain Netanyahu's intentions as trying to get  the support of the right. </s> <s>  What he is trying to do is make peace with  the right wing at the expense of making peace with us. </s> <s>  It means he  wants to continue on the path of non-negotiations, because he wants  to continue to be prime minister at any cost. </s> <s>  Sharon declined to  be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved  by the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that is expected. </s> <s>  An aide,  Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the position so that he could stem  the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the  risks facing Israel. </s> <s>  A retired general who fought in every Israeli  war, Sharon, 70, is a leading figure of the Likud Party who has done  much battle with the Likud prime minister. </s> <s>  At the most recent party  convention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from  his left, which the prime minister dismissed Friday as a comment made  in the height of political arguments. </s> <s>  And when Netanyahu first  formed his Cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give Sharon a  senior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in  ceremony. </s> <s>  Sharon retreated to his family farm in the Negev, and David  Levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve  unless Sharon was given a post. </s> <s>  Netanyahu then created a Cabinet job,  the minister of infrastructures, especially for Sharon. </s> <s>  Levy resigned  in January after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister,  and since then Netanyahu has been serving as his own foreign minister. </s> <s>   Sharon, a member of the old guard, has a complicated political past,  highlighted by a string of military victories, and checkered, to many,  by his indirect role, as defense minister, in the Lebanese Christian  Phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the Sabra and Shatila  refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. </s> <s>  Many Israelis, even those who despise  his politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who knows his  mind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power. </s> <s>  Friday  afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally  applauded the appointment. </s> <s>  Uzi Landau, who is a Likud hard-liner,  said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks. </s> <s>   I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon is directly  involved, said Landau, who heads the Parliament's security and foreign  affairs committee. </s> <s>  Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation  for the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon is identified  with the program, so therefore they can live with it. </s> <s>  Right before  the announcement was made, leaders of the National Religious Party,  who had threatened to bring down the government, changed their combative  tone. </s> <s>  They emerged mollified from meetings with Netanyahu late Thursday,  saying they would leave the government intact. </s> <s>  Still, they would not  connect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon. </s> <s>  Appointing  Sharon is a political step we like very much, said Shaul Yahalom,  the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious  Party. </s> <s>  But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement. </s> <s>   Our concern there is on whether any of the 160 Jewish settlements  are endangered. </s> <s>  The appointment of Sharon comes against a backdrop  of violence that has erupted this week. </s> <s>  Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli  soldier, Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man as  she got off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the  Jordan Valley. </s> <s>  Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy  note from Arafat, who condemned the attack. </s> <s>  Also Friday, in the continuing  clashes between Palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city  of Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullets  after the funeral of a Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday. </s> <s>   After Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter  introduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had diminished the  political threat from the right wing by appointing Sharon. </s> <s>  Are you  willing to sign on that? </s> <s>  Netanyahu said. </s> <s>  I do not know that. </s> <s>  I  do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or  two people you can never know what will be. </s> <s>  He was referring to  his razor-thin majority in parliament _ which some analysts perceive  to be his key motivator in appointing Sharon. </s> <s>  More than anything  else, this reflects the political weakness of Netanyahu, said Yaron  Ezrahi, a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister. </s> <s>  He  has recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't  want to be seen as contributing to the wave of political violence  that would follow a failure. </s> <s>  But he doesn't have the domestic political  power to carry out the big decision on his own. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Netanyahu picks Sharon as foreign minister to placate the far right. </s> </p> </d>
