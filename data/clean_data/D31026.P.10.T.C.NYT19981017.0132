article= <d> <p> <s>  A new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he  massaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on  the barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly  again and again. </s> <s>  Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he  reacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for  the first time. </s> <s>  You were saving the World Series trees until now,  right? </s> <s>  Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. </s> <s>   These are from World Series trees, aren't they? </s> <s>  Martinez could  joke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series  because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past  three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1  at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. </s> <s>  Major leaguer players who were watching  on television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World  Series wood. </s> <s>  Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats  during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still  alive for the title. </s> <s>  Martinez is still alive. </s> <s>  For now, Martinez, the  power hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around. </s> <s>   For now. </s> <s>  You always get a fresh start in the post-season because  it's game to game, said Martinez. </s> <s>  If you win, you've got another  game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. </s> <s>  It's easier  to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest  at-bat of the season. </s> <s>  Normally, having Martinez at the plate for  the biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the  Yankees. </s> <s>  But not when the calendar flips to October. </s> <s>  Martinez has  experienced another frustrating post-season. </s> <s>  He is 5 for 30 with 10  strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved  team that has batted . </s> <s> 229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games  because of superior pitching. </s> <s>  Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez,  their most valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter? </s> <s>  We've  just gotten through two good series, said Paul O'Neill. </s> <s>  The Yankees  won those series. </s> <s>  You don't focus on one guy. </s> <s>  You focus on winning. </s> <s>   The whole team won. </s> <s>  As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing  one line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman  is in a career drought in the post-season. </s> <s>  Since joining the Yankees,  Martinez is 20 for 107 (. </s> <s> 187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season  games. </s> <s>  Those are puny statistics, especially for a player who has  driven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three  years. </s> <s>  I would guess that Tino would have a great series, O'Neill  said. </s> <s>  Baseball has a way of evening things out. </s> <s>  You have a bad series,  you come back and have a great series. </s> <s>  In the season, that's easier  to do. </s> <s>  In the post-season, it gets tougher. </s> <s>  It cannot get much tougher  for Martinez, who was dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during  the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians  and will remain in that spot until further notice. </s> <s>  Martinez has blamed  his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. </s> <s>   He has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of  3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that  his previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue  the obviously unattainable five-run homer. </s> <s>  Actually, Martinez has  already made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in  his last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch  and 4 walks. </s> <s>  It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it  is something for him to cling to. </s> <s>  Until last night, anyway, when Martinez  had to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him  in 30 of 34 career at-bats. </s> <s>  If I was getting good pitches and missing  them, then I'd say I have a bad swing working, said Martinez. </s> <s>  But  I've been swinging at bad pitches. </s> <s>  Right now, I've just got to be  patient and wait. </s> <s>  The Yankees will wait with him. </s> <s>  They have to. </s> <s>   In the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez  at first in Games 3, 4 and 5. </s> <s>  It was a difficult decision because  Martinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the  Yankees until July 31. </s> <s>  But the Yankees grabbed all three games so  it worked. </s> <s>  Torre does not have such an attractive replacement this  season in Luis Sojo. </s> <s>  So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better  or worse, while he tries to stay positive and finally produce. </s> <s>  It's  the World Series, said Martinez. </s> <s>  You got to go out there and have  fun with it. </s> <s>  Big games are all big games. </s> <s>  You want to go out there  and enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. </s> <s>  You  don't think that you might lose that day. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Martinez jokes about bats being from World Series trees as game 1 nears. </s> </p> </d>
