article= <d> <p> <s>  The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a  Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. </s> <s>  cruise missile strike last month  to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind  of the bombings of two U.S. </s> <s>  embassies in East Africa, according to  U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence officials. </s> <s>  The evidence, the officials said last  week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical  plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic  Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there  of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. </s> <s>  Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives  money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his  terror network, the officials added. </s> <s>  This evidence was uncovered after  the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following  the bombing of the U.S. </s> <s>  embassies, the officials said. </s> <s>  A spokesman  for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either  to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. </s> <s>  In a statement provided  by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: I have absolutely  no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in  the world. </s> <s>  I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with  him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with  him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  officials  say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi  presence in Sudan since the missile attack. </s> <s>  Officials said they were  not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum. </s> <s>  But intelligence  agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa  plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the  chemical weapons program. </s> <s>  In addition, a soil sample that the CIA  clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical  used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. </s> <s>   The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his  decision to strike the Shifa plant. </s> <s>  Some State Department and CIA  officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based  on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. </s> <s>   The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States  has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since  1995 and the entire U.S. </s> <s>  Embassy since 1996. </s> <s>  In addition, more than  100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn  in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications. </s> <s>  That year  a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one  against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his  reports proved impossible to confirm. </s> <s>  Senior administration officials  say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence  of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program,  but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. </s> <s>   Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their  initial suspicions about Al Shifa. </s> <s>  At the time of the Aug. </s> <s>  20 cruise  missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they  did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. </s> <s>  The CIA, which had  begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's  ownership was irrelevant. </s> <s>  What we knew about the ownership was that  a lot of it couldn't be reliably established, said one senior U.S. </s> <s>   intelligence official. </s> <s>  Still, after the missile strike, when Idris  was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence began to investigate  his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. </s> <s>  A Sudanese  expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously  a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. </s> <s>   He bought the Shifa plant in March. </s> <s>  Officials say U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence  has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic  groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is  40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government  entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons  development. </s> <s>  Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial  Corp. </s> <s>  in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production,  and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against  U.S. </s> <s>  troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence. </s> <s>  But Pendry  denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial  Corp. </s> <s>  U.S. </s> <s>  intelligence officials declined to provide details about  the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. </s> <s>   But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin  Laden's terrorist campaign. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> New evidence links destroyed Sudanese factory to bin laden terrorist
