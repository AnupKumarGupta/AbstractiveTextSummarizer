article= <d> <p> <s>  Just four years ago, it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be  the pivotal figure in U.S. </s> <s>  politics at the turn of the millennium. </s> <s>   Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned  it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. </s> <s>  With a promise to  balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social  values, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress  just as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency. </s> <s>  But Gingrich's  leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the  speaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization. </s> <s>  A change this  dramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation  about election tactics. </s> <s>  What looked like one of the major realignments  in U.S. </s> <s>  political history might turn out to have been nothing but  a temporary shift. </s> <s>  The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a  revolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceived  as a Democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and  a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big  deficits. </s> <s>  They were the same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited  so successfully. </s> <s>  But old political habits and a moribund Republican  leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout  the 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined  tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps. </s> <s>   Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for political  organization finally took Reagan's formula for success to the congressional  elections in 1994. </s> <s>  But once in power, he ran head on into Bill Clinton,  whose political instincts were even better. </s> <s>  The president co-opted  parts of the Contract With America, particularly the balanced budget  and welfare reform. </s> <s>  He adapted the Republican social message into  a call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems,  which symbolized more responsibility and parental control without  supporting government intrusion into private lives. </s> <s>  The Republican  right's genuine contempt for Clinton was based in part on the well-known  flaws in the president's character. </s> <s>  But it was mainly a reaction to  the ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood  tide of their revolution. </s> <s>  They expected that the genuine successes  of Gingrich's first year in office would lead to still larger victories  for minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and a  return to conservative Christian values. </s> <s>  But the public was happy  to be led in another direction, and focus on the concerns of aging  baby boomers about health care and Social Security. </s> <s>  The government  that was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again  looked like a potential ally. </s> <s>  Back in 1994, both parties were so stunned  by the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may  have overestimated what it all meant. </s> <s>  In particular they may not have  realized how quickly good economic times, a drop in crime and national  welfare reform could blunt the power of race in U.S. </s> <s>  politics. </s> <s>  The  Democrats had become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully  identified their policies with cities, blacks and immigrants. </s> <s>  But  last week union workers and Catholics returned to the Democratic fold. </s> <s>   Without race as a wedge issue, the solid black Democratic vote became  a powerful advantage in key states. </s> <s>  Blacks, women and Latinos angry  at Republican anti-immigration initiatives were the winning coalition  in California, North Carolina and New York. </s> <s>  The speaker was right  to say this was not the election we expected. </s> <s>  There may indeed  be a Republican majority in America, but it appears to resemble the  Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich _ pro-business,  wary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bringing up messy social  issues like abortion. </s> <s>  The Republicans who have begun talking about  compassionate conservatism and the politics of inclusion may  be peddling political mush, but they peddled it to victory on Tuesday. </s> <s>   The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the wilderness  of the House minority may have left it too accustomed to opposition  to figure out what it can be for, and too attached to the politics  of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation. </s> <s>  Gingrich  has suggested that his mistake was to let the Republicans drift along  on the politics of impeachment when they should have been almost  maniacally focused on things like tax cuts. </s> <s>  But looking maniacal  is what got them into trouble in the first place. </s> <s>  Winning control  of Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 1994. </s> <s>   But it will be ten times tougher to forge a politics that does not  depend on rage. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Miracle worker Gingrich outmaneuvered by political tactician Clinton. </s> </p> </d>
