article= <d> <p> <s>  Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday,  its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands  and mainland communities. </s> <s>  At least 32 people were killed and widespread  flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. </s> <s>  Mitch,  once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today  as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that  flooded at least 50 rivers. </s> <s>  It also kicked up huge waves that pounded  seaside communities. </s> <s>  The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT,  it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160  kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of  early Tuesday. </s> <s>  After remaining virtually stationary for more than  a day, the U.S. </s> <s>  National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center  of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly  to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. </s> <s>  Hurricane-force  winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with  rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that. </s> <s>  Caught  near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40  kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. </s> <s>   The hurricane has destroyed almost everything, said Mike Brown,  a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. </s> <s>   Few houses have remained standing. </s> <s>  Honduran officials said 14  people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had  died elsewhere in the country. </s> <s>  More than 72,000 people had been evacuated  to shelters. </s> <s>  Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the  region by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to  just off the coast and seemed to park there. </s> <s>  An American was thrown  from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed  dead. </s> <s>  Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. </s> <s>  Honduran officials  said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm,  left without power, telephones or clean drinking water. </s> <s>  Agriculture  Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana  crops had been damaged and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain. </s> <s>   Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba,  a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers)  from the Bay Islands. </s> <s>  About 10,000 residents fled to crowded shelters  in schools, churches and firehouses. </s> <s>  While supplies of food and gasoline  seemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long  lines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took  measures to limit panic buying. </s> <s>  La Ceiba officials appealed for pure  water for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets  to collect rainwater. </s> <s>  Only a few hotels and offices with their own  generators had electricity. </s> <s>  Wind-whipped waves almost buried some  houses near the shore. </s> <s>  People evacuated low-lying houses by wading  through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads. </s> <s>   In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize  City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into  a ghost town. </s> <s>  Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few  people wandered amid the boarded-up houses. </s> <s>  The cable television company  was broadcasting only The Weather Channel. </s> <s>  With the storm seemingly  anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency  measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds  of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night. </s> <s>  More  than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas,  leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity. </s> <s>  Houston accountant  Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried  to leave Cancun but found all the flights full. </s> <s>  It's been horrible,  said Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor  restaurant. </s> <s>  We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling. </s> <s>   Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed, she said  dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. </s> <s>  Some vacation. </s> <s>  The U.S. </s> <s>   Agency for International Development sent two helicopters each to  Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief efforts. </s> <s>   At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in  this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor  Day hurricane of 1935. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Hurricane Mitch devastates Honduran coast for 3rd day, at least 32 killed. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
