article= <d> <p> <s>  The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing  sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came  and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement. </s> <s>  Still, a five-hour  meeting that was described as cordial by the league and almost like  two bulls letting off a little steam by the players association  produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. </s> <s>  Barring a  major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full  season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season  games to labor strife in November. </s> <s>  Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner,  said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before  deciding to cancel regular-season games. </s> <s>  He also discussed the possibility  of a significantly shortened season. </s> <s>  We haven't made a determination  that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative  season, Granik said. </s> <s>  But we recognize that beyond a certain point  we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season. </s> <s>   Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. </s> <s>   We have a few months before we have to face that decision. </s> <s>  Perhaps  the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown  Manhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session over the league's  latest proposal to the players. </s> <s>  Patrick Ewing, the union president,  and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the  meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union  lawyers. </s> <s>  No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern  and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies  of a two-week-old proposal to the players. </s> <s>  At one point before the  two parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices  and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a  participant in the meeting said. </s> <s>  But the two were seen shaking hands  and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 p.m. </s> <s>  There  was some venting from both sides, Hunter said. </s> <s>  We've been placid  and very respectful. </s> <s>  Today, we took the coats off and we were inclined  to take the gloves off a little bit. </s> <s>  Having done that, I think it  kind of loosened up both sides. </s> <s>  Hunter added: Did anybody blink  today? </s> <s>  They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can  find during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or  another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing  we might be open to something else. </s> <s>  We're looking at their body language,  too. </s> <s>  I don't think that they're ready to make a deal. </s> <s>  The last formal  meeting between both sides on Aug. </s> <s>  6 ended when Stern and the owners  abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> NBA talks produce no sign of settlement. </s> <s>  Full season now questionable. </s> </p> </d>
