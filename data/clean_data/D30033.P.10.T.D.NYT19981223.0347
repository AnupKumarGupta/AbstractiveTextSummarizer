article= <d> <p> <s>  Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers,  26, was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris. </s> <s>   When his phone went dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into  the underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent, the London-based  French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. </s> <s>   I definitely describe myself as a European, he said in the fluent  English he perfected working at an Australian bank. </s> <s>  I may get sentimental  when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical things,  I see myself as a citizen of Europe. </s> <s>  I like the lifestyle in France,  but I don't make my living there. </s> <s>  The year 1999 is the official  start-up date of the euro, the common European currency that will  unite 11 countries monetarily. </s> <s>  But throughout Europe, a different  kind of integration has already taken root. </s> <s>  Routiers, who was spending  a day in Paris to meet with his bank's French clients, is at the vanguard  of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves  for a shock in the new year. </s> <s>  Mobile, fluent in several languages and  aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of  borderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency  is supposed to advance. </s> <s>  They do not share their parents' memories  of World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. </s> <s>  People  worry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because  it suggests that at the end of the day, we have one government,  said Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in London. </s> <s>  Countries  are afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it as a bad  thing. </s> <s>  If a government is good, stable and efficient, who cares if  it is based in Berlin or Athens? </s> <s>  Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business  in the United States and Britain, could serve as a model for the new  Europeans. </s> <s>  He works for a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English  and French, and in the past year has traveled, among other places,  to Belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. </s> <s>  Like hundreds  of thousands of other Europeans, he chose London _ and its busy financial  markets _ as the best place to work. </s> <s>  He said he does not feel as if  he lives in England. </s> <s>  He lives in London, the clubhouse of financial  Europe. </s> <s>  And membership has its privileges. </s> <s>  Papadopoulos lives in the  fashionable Knightsbridge area, drives a Porsche he bought in Brussels,  and works out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. </s> <s>  I went  to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners'  I met were from the Middle East, he says. </s> <s>  Now friends and co-workers  are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. </s> <s>  You feel  it everywhere. </s> <s>  The streets are jammed with foreigners. </s> <s>  Not tourists  _ people who live and work here. </s> <s>  Baby-boomers in Europe often describe  themselves as the 1968 generation, weaned on the protest and social  turmoil that convulsed European societies 30 years ago. </s> <s>  Less dramatic  but equally significant was a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement  within what were then the six countries of the Common Market. </s> <s>  A Frenchman  could work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a  permit. </s> <s>  Back then some economists dourly predicted huge migrations,  particularly of unskilled laborers moving from southern countries  to the more prosperous north. </s> <s>  Actually, as huge industries like steel  shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunities for working-class  Europeans. </s> <s>  There are 15 countries within what is now the European  Union, but only a small percentage of their citizens have moved to  other countries, according to estimates prepared by Eurostat. </s> <s>  Those  who do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids  or garbage collectors. </s> <s>  There are still legal barriers preventing most  doctors, lawyers and academics from finding work in other countries. </s> <s>   So far the European Union has been most profitably put to use by white-collar  business executives who eagerly followed career opportunities across  national borders, time zones and language barriers. </s> <s>  Twenty-five years  ago that kind of mobility was the preserve of a far smaller elite,  the top executives of major companies or multinational corporations. </s> <s>   Technology, from high-speed trains to the ever-evolving apparatus  of business _ lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines _ has made  European mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs  and even students. </s> <s>  Cable television, which allows Germans to watch  Italian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs, has spread  the Zeitgeist to the masses. </s> <s>  This year Superga, an Italian brand of  sports clothes and shoes, opened a major advertising campaign with  a series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily  cavorting with European leaders _ a leggy young woman pushes her bicycle  up the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac,  a young man playfully sticks his tongue out the window of the plane  of the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. </s> <s>  This kind of ad would  not have been possible five or 10 years ago, said Aldo Cernuto,  executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche  Lowe, an international advertising agency. </s> <s>  Now European unification  is on the TV all the time; it has seeped into people's unconscious. </s> <s>   Even people who do not care about politics recognize the faces of  a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. </s> <s>  Ten years ago, very few people did. </s> <s>   According to the European Union, Britain has twice as many EU citizens  as France, but it is not the country with the highest concentration  of residents from other European countries. </s> <s>  According to estimates  based on surveys prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third of the residents  of tiny Luxembourg, which has low unemployment and a high standard  of living, are from other European countries. </s> <s>  Belgium, which has the  European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5. </s> <s> 4 percent. </s> <s>   Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that  has held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the nerve  center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans  _ bankers and business executives drawn by London's financial district,  a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. </s> <s>   Perhaps just as surprisingly, London also serves as an example of  another less obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism _ the breakdown  of certain social barriers. </s> <s>  Studying abroad was once a privilege reserved  to the sons and daughters of Europe's elite. </s> <s>  Now the European Union  has a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that  this year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent  of the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries  within the Union for up to a year, free. </s> <s>  In the last 20 years, business  schools in Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S. </s> <s> -style MBA programs  that teach an American approach to business. </s> <s>  This too has allowed  a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business. </s> <s>  Juergen  Schrempp, the head of Daimler, started as a car mechanic, noted  Stephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins  University School for International Studies in Washington. </s> <s>  That  would have been unthinkable in Germany 20 years ago. </s> <s>  Social mobility,  moreover, is fueled by movement. </s> <s>  When people transfer to another country,  they find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trappings  of home. </s> <s>  I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed  in Paris, Routier explained. </s> <s>  France is still very hierarchical. </s> <s>   Bosses want to know where you went to school, what your father does. </s> <s>   In London, none of that matters as long as you make money. </s> <s>  Many  Britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions. </s> <s>   For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines  in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago,  and never looked back. </s> <s>  He has lived all over Europe, and is fluent  in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. </s> <s>  His father,  a car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. </s> <s>  Smith  said he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home. </s> <s>  I  didn't go to public schools or Oxbridge, he explained. </s> <s>  I'm not  saying its impossible, but it would have been much more difficult  in England. </s> <s>  Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves  bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth  and breeding do not matter as much. </s> <s>  Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work  in London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent. </s> <s>  Mrs. </s> <s>   Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and  Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both  were attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan  in 1995. </s> <s>  Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four languages and has lived  and traveled all over the world. </s> <s>  She works on the Eastern European  desk of a British bank; he works for a major international consulting  firm. </s> <s>  Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. </s> <s>  Iliffe said  the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible  for her to find as good a job. </s> <s>  I went to job interviews at Italian  banks and they only asked me about my husband's job, she said with  a grimace. </s> <s>  And they made it clear that they were afraid I would  get pregnant and ask for maternity leave. </s> <s>  Philippe Haspeslagh, 48,  a professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school  in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, called Mrs. </s> <s>  Iliffe's choices cherry-picking  _ choosing the best deal for herself. </s> <s>  As he put it, If they cannot  find what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere. </s> <s>   Twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh was a pioneer when he did the same  thing. </s> <s>  A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he lives and teaches  in France and does consulting work all over Europe, from Sweden to  the Czech Republic. </s> <s>  The message on his cell phone is in three languages  _ French, Flemish and English. </s> <s>  His students, a generation behind him,  see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. </s> <s>  These Europeans form  an advance guard that is still relatively small in numbers, but experts  say they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies. </s> <s>  In  Germany, for example, it is the business people who are pushing ahead  with change and pulling politicians along behind them kicking and  screaming, Szabo said. </s> <s>  They are looking at a larger market and  feel the competitive pressures of globalization. </s> <s>  Politicians are responding  to a domestic constituency. </s> <s>  They are answering to an international  one. </s> </p>
