article= <d> <p> <s>  In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese  courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11  years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political  party. </s> <s>  The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial  in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years. </s> <s>   His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced  to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days  after his trial. </s> <s>  Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition  group of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community  at large of a strong and moderating voice. </s> <s>  Xu remained defiant during  his tightly controlled trial on subversion charges. </s> <s>  He refused to  answer questions from prosecutors and judges and responded only to  those from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping,  said. </s> <s>  When the court asked if he would appeal, Xu Wenli said he  would not appeal, Mo said, quoting his client as saying this is  political persecution. </s> <s>  Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict. </s> <s>   All he wanted to do was to advocate free speech and make sure the  party registers peacefully. </s> <s>  But the government failed this test, and  now my father has to go to jail again for it, said daughter Xu Jin,  a graduate student at Boston University. </s> <s>  Security forces have orchestrated  a concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards to  crush the China Democracy Party. </s> <s>  In three weeks, at least 32 people  have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading  member, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial. </s> <s>  All three were charged  with trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. </s> <s>  Xu and  Qin were given less than four days to prepare their defenses. </s> <s>  Last  Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police  detained or scared off potential lawyers. </s> <s>  No verdict has been announced  in Qin's case. </s> <s>  Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang  plotted subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party  in both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua  News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities. </s> <s>  The courts  ruled the two should be severely punished as repeat offenders,  Xinhua said in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. </s> <s>   Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and  plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's  Court Monday for Xu's trial. </s> <s>  Foreign reporters were kept 500 meters  (yards) away from the building. </s> <s>  Xu's wife was the only friend or family  member given permission to watch the proceedings, along with an audience  selected by court officials. </s> <s>  She was escorted from her home to the  courthouse by three plainclothes officers. </s> <s>  Hours after the verdict,  He Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. </s> <s>   Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues and  kept watch on the houses of others. </s> <s>  Members of the China Democracy  Party will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy,  said Gao Hongmin, whose home was under surveillance. </s> <s>  Gao, who helped  Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said authorities would not  be able to arrest all the party's supporters. </s> <s>  In just six months,  the party attracted enough of a following to try to register branches  in 14 provinces and cities. </s> <s>  The U.S. </s> <s>  government and exiled dissidents,  many of whom supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences  and called for the dissidents' release. </s> <s>  We are deeply disappointed  with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given  to Mr. Xu, said U.S. </s> <s>  Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. </s> <s>  No individual  should be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising internationally  recognized freedoms. </s> <s>  Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the  Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison,  mostly in solitary confinement. </s> <s>  Since his parole ended last year,  he has been behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities. </s> <s>   He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in setting  up an independent human rights monitor and advised others to run for  local legislative seats in Beijing. </s> <s>  Xu became openly involved in the  China Democracy Party in November. </s> <s>  Wang Youcai, a student leader of  the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32,  publicly declared the China Democracy Party's formation in June and  said the group intended to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year  ban on opposition politics. </s> <s>  Police have sporadically detained supporters  of the democracy party. </s> <s>  The decisive move came on Nov. </s> <s>  30 as Chinese  Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy  two years of diplomatic forays. </s> <s>  In a speech broadcast nationwide on  Friday, Jiang warned against subversives trying to bring down the  system and vowed never to copy Western democracy. </s> <s>  To allay international  criticism, China released a respected labor rights campaigner, Liu  Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and sent him  into exile in the United States. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> China gives 2 activists long prison terms for organizing opposition party. </s> </p> </d>
