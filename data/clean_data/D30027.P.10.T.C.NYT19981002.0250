article= <d> <p> <s>  In a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks,  failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate  insult. </s> <s>  But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regards  a well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckling a little this  week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. </s> <s>   The Post Office is broke. </s> <s>  In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions,  more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with  up to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. </s> <s>  The state Railway  Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good  on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's  dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. </s> <s>  Air mail, which  amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at  one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office  coughed up 5 million rubles for old bills. </s> <s>  A second airport is still  demanding 3 million rubles for past-due debts. </s> <s>  So much mail is backed  up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting  out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck. </s> <s>   Delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind. </s> <s>   The situation is really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov,  the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's  Communications Committee. </s> <s>  We've never had anything like this before. </s> <s>   Maybe the Post Office has been lucky. </s> <s>  Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere  in Russia. </s> <s>  Until Friday, the lower house of Parliament was preparing  to sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper  and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. </s> <s>   It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting  short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic  crisis. </s> <s>  Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping  routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers  are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. </s> <s>  The oldest of  the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny. </s> <s>  Such anecdotal  evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained  Volga sedans, is everywhere. </s> <s>  But oddly, real signs of public distress  are not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seems  to shed a part as big as a postal system. </s> <s>  If the U.S. </s> <s>  Postal Service  is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the  Russian Post Office still holds a special place in the national conversation. </s> <s>   Russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently,  and many in remote regions get their news through the mail. </s> <s>  Millions  use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives  and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. </s> <s>   And in the last few years, the Post Office has become a vehicle for  a growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalog items  not readily available outside big cities. </s> <s>  Exactly why all this has  rumbled to a halt is in some dispute. </s> <s>  What is clear is that the Post  Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ails every Russian  venture, private and public alike: Nobody pays his bills. </s> <s>  The state  Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers  who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether  they are paid or not. </s> <s>  The government has specified nearly 40 categories  of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing. </s> <s>  Among  the biggest deadbeats are the power ministries _ the military  and interior departments _ which did not pay during Soviet times and  feel little need to pay now. </s> <s>  It's a psychology formed during the  socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman  for the ministry, and the same situation exists with the Post Office. </s> <s>   We've been in dispute for a very long time. </s> <s>  Always we try to understand  their differences. </s> <s>  But we can't carry cargo for free. </s> <s>  No kidding,  says the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million rubles by government  agencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs  are outstripping revenues. </s> <s>  Moreover, the Post Office is also required  by the government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks,  at reduced rates. </s> <s>  Officials at the state Communications Department  say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions:  a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business. </s> <s>  Here's  competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels,  and I think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by  this competition, Sherekhov said. </s> <s>  They blame us for carrying some  commercial cargoes instead of mail. </s> <s>  The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman,  Ms. Pashkova, said such commercial cargoes are indeed a problem,  but only because the railroads know that the Post Office has already  gotten cash to transport the packages. </s> <s>  The railroads are still waiting  for their share of that money, she said. </s> <s>  In the meantime, the situation  has come to a boil. </s> <s>  In late September the railroads cut mail service  in and out of Moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and  forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and  out of the city. </s> <s>  Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged  some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for  unloading has become difficult. </s> <s>  At last count, 39 loaded cars were  awaiting service at one yard. </s> <s>  And customers are getting angry. </s> <s>  We've  gotten all kinds of complaints, said Viktor Salikov, a deputy in  the Communications Department's mail shipping center. </s> <s>  People are  even coming to us, searching for mail that was sent weeks ago. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Russian mail delivery grinds
