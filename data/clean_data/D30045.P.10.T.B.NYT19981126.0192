article= <d> <p> <s>  Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger  or some other business combination, America's economic history is  already being rewritten. </s> <s>  In energy as in businesses like financial  services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and  technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. </s> <s>   Oil companies like Exxon Corp. </s> <s>  and Mobil Corp. </s> <s>  have an additional  pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago. </s> <s>  Crude oil prices  have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels,  adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo  25 years ago. </s> <s>  As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting  their costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue  operating profitably with such low prices. </s> <s>  Exxon and Mobil are the  two largest, strongest competitors to emerge from the nation's most  famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard  Oil Trust. </s> <s>  Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger  than either of them. </s> <s>  They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC  made far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer  to buy Amoco Corp. </s> <s>  for $48. </s> <s> 2 billion. </s> <s>  Industry executives say further  deals on this scale are inevitable. </s> <s>  Executives at both companies did  not return calls Thursday for comment on the talks, and it was unclear  Thursday night what the outcome might be. </s> <s>  But if Exxon and Mobil agree  to become one, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about  putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart. </s> <s>  Even  so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from  combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than  the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would  do to raise them. </s> <s>  The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the  consumer, said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research  Associates. </s> <s>  If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could  prove heaviest for energy industry employees. </s> <s>  Analysts say that of  the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas,  and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would  be likely to lose their jobs. </s> <s>  Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil,  with Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executives who have been preoccupied  with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary. </s> <s>   Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting  era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of  the 1970s. </s> <s>  Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in  much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing  further on already depressed prices. </s> <s>  They're pitiful, helpless giants,  said Ronald Chernow, the author of Titan, a biography of John  D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. </s> <s>  As such, these giants are  compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their  huge, expensive international projects that are needed to develop  oil reserves needed for the next century. </s> <s>  Mobil, with $58. </s> <s> 4 billion  in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. </s> <s>   But in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in  Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match  Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more. </s> <s>  Oil companies  have decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to  revive their fortunes any time soon. </s> <s>  Earlier this month, the Energy  Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue  to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5. </s> <s> 50  a barrel in the year 2000. </s> <s>  And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending  their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices. </s> <s>  Moreover, improving  technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions  to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is  on hand now. </s> <s>  In response, many energy companies have already begun  a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations. </s> <s>  To further  reduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop  short of full mergers. </s> <s>  Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its  European refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's,  resulting in annual savings of about $500 million. </s> <s>  Shell and Texaco  then formed a refining partnership in the United States. </s> <s>  In the face  of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the  James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, if you're  an Exxon, how do you compete? </s> <s>  Though Mobil and Exxon might have  high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United  States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than  before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s. </s> <s>  Thousands of convenience  stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies,  and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies  through acquired companies like Citgo. </s> <s>  Under Noto, Mobil has been  hunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive. </s> <s>  He  took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered  buying up smaller companies. </s> <s>  And he has made it clear that corporate  or personal pride would never block a deal. </s> <s>  In the European agreement  with British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from  the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos  have gone up. </s> <s>  As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an  analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, If the price is right,  egos will not get in the way. </s> <s>  In the past, Mobil reportedly had  further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as  well as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture. </s> <s>   The company was also interested in Conoco Inc. </s> <s>  when DuPont Co. began  looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business. </s> <s>  But no deals  were reached. </s> <s>  More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street  that Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp. </s> <s>  British Petroleum purchase  of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said. </s> <s>  I  don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum  had not pulled the trigger, he said. </s> <s>  The British Petroleum-Amoco  deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an  expected $2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large  as Exxon on the spot. </s> <s>  There, Raymond has so far concentrated more  on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies. </s> <s>  Though  Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's,  some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb  a company of Mobil's size. </s> <s>  Only the largest oil companies can afford  to take advantage of today's best opportunities. </s> <s>  Finding new fields  in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of  Mexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more. </s> <s>  Producing  oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and  money than many investors anticipated. </s> <s>  In September, Noto was among  the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington  to greatly step up investments in his country, too. </s> <s>  Noto spent from  1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations  including a huge refinery. </s> <s>  But any new partnerships with the Saudis  might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. </s> <s>  Back when  Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard  Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York. </s> <s>  Even  after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained for several  years in the same building in Manhattan. </s> <s>  Chernow, the Rockefeller  biographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already  likely to be united. </s> <s>  British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio  in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana. </s> <s>  The break-up  of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited  as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. </s> <s>   Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil  to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. </s> <s>  Exxon  would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way  Microsoft is, he said. </s> <s>  In the energy business today, he added, there  are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Exxon and Mobil may join because of plunging crude oil prices. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
