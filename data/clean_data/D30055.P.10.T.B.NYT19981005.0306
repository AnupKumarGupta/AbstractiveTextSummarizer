article= <d> <p> <s>  Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting  alliances. </s> <s>  And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled  government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. </s> <s>  A  leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist  Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision  to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender  majority in Parliament. </s> <s>  Prodi must realize that his majority no  longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding  Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after  they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union  in 1991. </s> <s>  Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the  last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis. </s> <s>  Cossuta  was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party  in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded as having  torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 years. </s> <s>  But the  leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti,  seems to have no such compunctions. </s> <s>  On Friday, he told journalists  that he was not worried about forcing new elections that could return  the right to power. </s> <s>  Sometimes you have to take one step back in  order to take two steps forward, he said with a shrug. </s> <s>  Until now,  however, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view. </s> <s>   When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over  proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced  to backpedal. </s> <s>  Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  and coalition leaders to devise a strategy. </s> <s>  He is expected to go to  Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough  votes for the budget. </s> <s>  Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely  to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line  with Germany and other bigger European neighbors before the introduction  Jan. </s> <s>  1 of the single European currency, the euro. </s> <s>  But even if he gathers  enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be left without  a majority. </s> <s>  After two and a half years in office, his government is  the second-longest in the postwar era. </s> <s>  But the fragile center-left  coalition has held together mostly because Italians were united for  the last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and  government borrowing to meet the requirements for membership in the  euro plan. </s> <s>  Once that goal was achieved last spring, dissension quickly  revived. </s> <s>  Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist  Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the  coalition. </s> <s>  If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices. </s> <s>  He  can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing  the opposition to power. </s> <s>  Or he could seek to form a new majority without  the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right  party of Francesco Cossiga. </s> <s>  Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue  in June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO  expansion. </s> <s>  But Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with  the center-left majority that elected him in 1996. </s> <s>  Cossiga also suggested  to reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join  a coalition led by Prodi. </s> <s>  We wouldn't want this majority to get  stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Prodi goes to Scalfaro for help; budget needed for Jan. </s> <s>  1 switch to euro. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
