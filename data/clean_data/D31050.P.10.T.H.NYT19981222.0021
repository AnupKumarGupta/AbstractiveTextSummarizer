article= <d> <p> <s>  Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged  China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's  policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese  courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to  long jail sentences. </s> <s>  Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights  groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of  the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties  with China in hopes of democratic reform. </s> <s>  The dissidents _ Xu Wenli,  who was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received  an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received  12 years were charged with subversion. </s> <s>  The State Department said it  had received reports from sources it did not identify that a third  leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13  years in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. </s> <s>  Relatives  of Qin in China denied the reports, however, and said that his trial  continued. </s> <s>  Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders  during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself  on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences,  even as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of  engagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy. </s> <s>  James Foley,  a State Department spokesman, said the United States deeply deplores  the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents. </s> <s>   These three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than  efforts to form a new political party, he said. </s> <s>  While condemning  the prison sentences, Foley and other American officials were careful  to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress  in human rights in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in  Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. </s> <s>  There had been improvements  in the human rights situation in China, modest improvements, Foley  said. </s> <s>  The severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment  of democracy campaigners in China _ are steps backward in relationship  to what had been an improved human rights performance, he said. </s> <s>   Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison  sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang delivered a  pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic  reforms were not a prelude to Western-style democracy. </s> <s>  The Western  mode of political systems must never be copied, he said, adding  that those who challenged the Communist Party's supremacy would be  crushed. </s> <s>  Rep. </s> <s>  Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. </s> <s> , who has long been among China's  harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out  to Xu and Wang were the clearest demonstration since the president's  visit to China last summer of Beijing's true intentions regarding  human rights. </s> <s>  They are pathetic, really pathetic, she said of  the administration. </s> <s>  The administration can say what it wants, but  it must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. </s> <s>   What the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in  the world. </s> <s>  Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights  Group, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration  to revise its China policy, which he described as almost entirely  driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade. </s> <s>  He said  that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights  situation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement  to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the  overall picture was bleak. </s> <s>  On balance, he said, any progress  China has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled  out by a more repressive attitude. </s> <s>  Human Rights Watch, the largest  American-based human rights group, called on the administration to  consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next  year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation  as a protest over the prison sentences. </s> <s>  That would get Beijing's  attention, Jendrzejczck said. </s> <s>  Other China experts and scholars insisted  that the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement  with China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform  would follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued. </s> <s>  Peter Rodman,  a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon  Center in Washington, said that the United States cannot control  the evolution of a society as complex as China's. </s> <s>  He said the harsh  prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected,  especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up  a political party to challenge the Communists. </s> <s>  The pattern of this  regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody  goes too far and there's a crisis, he said. </s> <s>  I don't think you  can blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give us  credit for any political reforms. </s> <s>  On human rights, I just don't think  there's much more we can do. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Clinton, China policy, Jiang, Xu, Wang, Qin, human
