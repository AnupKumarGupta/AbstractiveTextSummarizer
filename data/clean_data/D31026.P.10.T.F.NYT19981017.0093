article= <d> <p> <s>  Talk about high expectations. </s> <s>  It's not just the man from Tampa who  has them anymore. </s> <s>  Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody  in the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series  and the league championship series as just so much parsley on the  plate of life. </s> <s>  The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so  I can see all those people, Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying  before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it  San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. </s> <s>  Now that the Yankees  are in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they  themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. </s> <s>   Anything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. </s> <s>  But why should the  Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off  the bus to this World Series? </s> <s>  The gloom and doom in the six other  cities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and  the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. </s> <s>   The three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into  football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one  exalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers,  condemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking them in  their sore spots for eternity. </s> <s>  The World Series used to be a short  and sweet reward for excellence, but that was when there were eight  teams per league, and the winners met in daylight in early October. </s> <s>   Even if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission  once again, well, there was always next year. </s> <s>  But in 1969, baseball  began league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered  playoff system. </s> <s>  The World Series is still different, which is why  we should all resist the babble of post-season records flung at  us by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from  the dozens of different networks that carry baseball. </s> <s>  The World Series  is still a competition between one league that encourages pitchers  to be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. </s> <s>  Somehow  the playoffs leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. </s> <s>  Think  about it. </s> <s>  The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot  perform in the post-season. </s> <s>  The Texas Rangers are sulking because  they had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee  pitching when it counted. </s> <s>  In Chicago, the glory of winning a special  playoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been  pre-empted. </s> <s>  The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern  title held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh  and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. </s> <s>  Speaking of indignity,  there are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs  is merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. </s> <s>  In Atlanta, the  team of the '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is up  to management to keep repeating that: The main goal is to get to  the Series. </s> <s>  This is a recorded announcement. </s> <s>  This is a recorded announcement. </s> <s>   This is a recorded announcement. </s> <s>  In Cleveland, the fans had to live  with the phrase Nineteen forty-eight! </s> <s>  being chanted at the Indians  in the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. </s> <s>  That leaves  the Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. </s> <s>  This can  be good, or it can be bad. </s> <s>  Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on  the 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: A lot of the players  on that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little  different attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World  Series. </s> <s> ' And this year, I think you will see the players out there  playing to win. </s> <s>  Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he  said his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. </s> <s>  I am sure that  is the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't  predicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,  Torre said. </s> <s>  I think getting here is where the pressure is, Torre  added. </s> <s>  You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough  after playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having  to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here. </s> <s>  Torre  continued: You don't think about in spring training that we want  to go and win the World Series. </s> <s>  You want to get to the World Series. </s> <s>   Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough  games, then of course, we want to win. </s> <s>  As far as legitimizing our  season _ I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego  happens to win the World Series, sure it takes a little bit of the  luster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think  that was our goal, initially. </s> <s>  The key word in that sentence is initially. </s> <s>   The Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World  Series tickets in the Torre family. </s> <s>  While they're at it, the Yankees  had better win the whole thing. </s> <s>  They are a victim of their own excellence. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Post-season gains importance with 2-layered play-offs, league championships. </s> </p> </d>
