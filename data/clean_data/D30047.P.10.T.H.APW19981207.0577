article= <d> <p> <s>  Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first  piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control  module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. </s> <s>   Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered  the most difficult part of the mission. </s> <s>  The job fell to Nancy Currie,  the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned  Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. </s> <s>  The two station pieces are so  big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined  mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to  have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather  than direct line of sight. </s> <s>  Such a blind docking had never been  attempted before. </s> <s>  Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time  for the tasks. </s> <s>  The main thing I've tried to do for the last two  years working on this flight is make sure we have time. </s> <s>  We have margin  on everything, said flight director Bob Castle. </s> <s>  Before beginning  their final approach to Zarya _ Russian for Sunrise _ the shuttle's  six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched  last month from California. </s> <s>  Mission Control ordered the pilots to  fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour  and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the  orbiting debris. </s> <s>  The smaller gap would have been probably a little  too close for comfort, Mission Control said. </s> <s>  The bigger worry, by  far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling  with Unity. </s> <s>  The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been  assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya,  a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on  Nov. </s> <s>  20. </s> <s>  It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering  for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can  be launched next summer. </s> <s>  The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve  as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. </s> <s>  In case  Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking  astronauts would have to manually fit them together. </s> <s>  The astronauts  would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and  cables between the two components. </s> <s>  In all, three spacewalks were planned  for Endeavour's 12-day flight. </s> <s>  NASA estimates 43 more launches and  159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble  the entire orbiting complex. </s> <s>  Once completed, the 16-nation space station  will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field,  and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Curie, Endeavor, Zarya, Unity, blind docking, space junk, spacewalk. </s> </p> </d>
