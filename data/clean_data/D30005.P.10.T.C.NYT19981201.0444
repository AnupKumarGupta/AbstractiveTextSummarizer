article= <d> <p> <s>  Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat  down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. </s> <s>  He was worried,  he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the East Africa  network of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a  worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. </s> <s>  The organization,  the author complained, had declared war against the United States,  yet he had learned of that only from the news media. </s> <s>  The writer, who  federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one  of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. </s> <s>  Embassy in Nairobi  a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest  of an aide to bin Laden. </s> <s>  Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said  he was worried that an important man with close links to bin Laden,  seemed to have fallen into the enemy's hands. </s> <s>  He said the Americans  were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that  he had to take precautions. </s> <s>  The cell is at 100 percent danger,  the operative warned. </s> <s>  The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital  evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer  in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed  in U.S. </s> <s>  District Court in New York City. </s> <s>  The papers said the computer  was seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was  attended by an FBI agent. </s> <s>  The documents did not make clear whether  the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings  of the U.S. </s> <s>  Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. </s> <s>   7 of this year. </s> <s>  The timing is potentially important because there  have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the  United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist  attack on American targets in Kenya. </s> <s>  Officials of the FBI and the  U.S. </s> <s>  attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night  at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they  make any other comment. </s> <s>  Fazil eluded American investigators after  the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands  and then to the Middle East. </s> <s>  He remains a fugitive. </s> <s>  The dispatch provides  a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the  twilight of the 20th century. </s> <s>  The author talks of how he and his fellow  operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. </s> <s>   He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East  Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on  big decisions. </s> <s>  Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document  seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against  bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that  his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's  door by federal authorities _ the attacks on American soldiers in  Somalia in 1993 and 1994. </s> <s>  The writer of the document warned that the  followers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as the sheik, had  become America's primary target. </s> <s>  He said his comrades in East  Africa should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence  activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of  the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows  well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's  cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia. </s> <s>  They know that  since Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be  a center in Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We are really in danger. </s> <s>   The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare  and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants. </s> <s>  Federal  authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of  bin Laden, directed Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about  the security situation of the cell. </s> <s>  Fawwaz, who served as an informal  press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities  in September after the embassy bombings. </s> <s>  He has denied any connection  to terrorist activities. </s> <s>  A translation of the report was part of a  package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to  support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. </s> <s>  It is not  clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded  to bin Laden. </s> <s>  The documents, which were initially filed in secret,  include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with  bin Laden to kill Americans overseas. </s> <s>  A second count charges him with  soliciting others to do so. </s> <s>  The report made clear that the organization  was being run on a shoestring. </s> <s>  Its author wrote that his mother has  fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a  visit. </s> <s>  What do you think? </s> <s>  Keep in mind we only have $500. </s> <s>  He repeatedly  expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was  in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. </s> <s>   There is a war and the situation is dangerous, he said. </s> <s>  He wrote  that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national  security or American citizens. </s> <s>  The author noted with alarm a recent  CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees  had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United  States for trial. </s> <s>  According to federal authorities, Fazil went on  to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. </s> <s>  Prosecutors  assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed  the embassy's security precautions. </s> <s>  On Aug. </s> <s>  7, they charge, Fazil  drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle  carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. </s> <s>   The author of the report said that he stood ready to fight the forces  of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth. </s> <s>  He said that  the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all  its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go underground  for a while if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. </s> <s>   We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the  operations plans, he wrote,  since we are just implementers.
