article= <d> <p> <s>  An intense struggle for control of the House is underway, with Rep. </s> <s>   Bob Livingston conducting a telephone campaign to replace Rep. </s> <s>  Newt  Gingrich as speaker and Gingrich fighting with a counter-campaign  that has given some members pause about ousting him. </s> <s>  At the same time,  a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not  vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because  of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in  knots for months because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat. </s> <s>   Rep. </s> <s>  Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. </s> <s> , said: I personally have made the decision  that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there  are six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people  who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock the vote. </s> <s>  Fury at  the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans  suffered a net loss of five seats in the House. </s> <s>  They blamed Gingrich,  the party's chief strategist. </s> <s>  But many were already angry at him for  what they said was his failure to articulate a clear message for the  party going into the elections and for a messy budget process that  gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican  principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amounts  of pork spending. </s> <s>  House Republicans are to meet Nov. </s> <s>  18 to vote by  secret ballot for their leaders. </s> <s>  Whoever wins the party's nomination  for speaker then stands for election by the full House in January. </s> <s>   Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election  as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to  vote for him. </s> <s>  Because the Republicans now control the House by only  12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him  a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own  as speaker. </s> <s>  With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming,  Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of  the party, according to Republican officials. </s> <s>  The officials said that  Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election  returns but also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier  displeasure with the speaker over the budget process. </s> <s>  Several Republicans  said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee  and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker,  and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for  votes. </s> <s>  Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich,  but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce  his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, after he had determined  if he could win. </s> <s>  He won't do it 'til he has his ducks in a row,  and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker, said  an aide to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle  the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement  to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> GOP in House jockeying for control; Newt loses 6 votes; is he on way out? </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
