article= <d> <p> <s>  Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers  scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling  a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats. </s> <s>   Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok  Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge  the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team. </s> <s>   The games open Dec. </s> <s>  6. </s> <s>  We're not sure if this is related to the  Saudi jewel scandal, Bhichai told Thai radio. </s> <s>  But regardless,  we should not mix sports with politics. </s> <s>  In a letter to the Thai  prime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers,  Saudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan  and national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling  out. </s> <s>  But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the  continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious  jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home. </s> <s>  Thai  police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many were fakes  _ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members  of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. </s> <s>  The real jewels have never  been recovered. </s> <s>  Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three  Saudi diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. </s> <s>  In retaliation, the Saudis  barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the  thousands already in the desert kingdom. </s> <s>  The killings remain unsolved. </s> <s>   Saudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when the  two cases were solved. </s> <s>  Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman,  said it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because  of Ramadan fasting. </s> <s>  If there is any other reason behind this, such  as the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because  sports should be separated from politics, Kobsak said. </s> <s>  Organizers  noted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams. </s> <s>  Suggestions  were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia should consider  punishing last-minute withdrawals. </s> <s>  Organizers need to hold new draws  for both handball and basketball because of the pullout, but said  the live television coverage schedule will not be affected. </s> <s>  The withdrawal  is expected to cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's  expenses for organizing programs, accommodation and television schedules. </s> <s>   They said they would consult with the council, which oversees the  organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal. </s> <s>   Officials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted Tuesday  during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar. </s> <s>  The scoreless  match was suspended without further play after players from both sides  kicked, punched and body-slammed each other for about 10 minutes. </s> <s>   Several suffered light injuries. </s> <s>  As a host, surely the melee will  have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand, said Santiparb  Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. </s> <s>  Nobody wanted  that incident to happen. </s> <s>  Officials said that forgiveness was a better  option than punishment and that both sides would be admonished not  to let a repeat brawl occur. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Theft and murder of diplomats may explain Saudi withdrawal from Asian Games. </s> </p> </d>
