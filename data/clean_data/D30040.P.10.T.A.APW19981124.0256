article= <d> <p> <s>  Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday  inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the  world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism. </s> <s>  An Egypt  Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern  Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. </s> <s>  (0630 gmt). </s> <s>  But the emotional highlight was  the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. </s> <s>   After landing, the pilot and co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high  above their heads as they descended the stairway. </s> <s>  A chant of Allahu  Akbar, or God is Great, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians  who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations. </s> <s>   You are a beautiful sight, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later  told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly decorated with  deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics. </s> <s>  Throughout the morning,  Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes  from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian  Airlines flights. </s> <s>  This is a preparation for the declaration of the  Palestinian state, Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V  sign. </s> <s>  However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has the  authority to shut down the airfield at any time. </s> <s>  It will monitor arriving  passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers  them a danger to Israeli security. </s> <s>  Disputes between Israel and the  Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening  for more than two years. </s> <s>  In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian  security agents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and  collected the passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinet  ministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags. </s> <s>  Throughout the morning,  there were spontaneous celebrations. </s> <s>  As a police marching band played  bagpipes, airport workers, policemen and Cabinet ministers held each  other by their hands and danced in a circle. </s> <s>  Some kissed and embraced  their neighbors, others wiped away tears and several officers waved  their rifles in the air. </s> <s>  In one corner of the airfield, about 300  people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to  the beat of drums. </s> <s>  The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost  to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian  flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel,  often with difficulties and delays. </s> <s>  The airfield will also make it  easier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans  are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket. </s> <s>  Until now,  Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel  and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv. </s> <s>  The  other option was to travel by land to Jordan and catch flights there. </s> <s>   Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross  Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. </s> <s>  Travel is expected to become  easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens next  month. </s> <s>  Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian  airport, citing security reasons. </s> <s>  However, Israeli Foreign Minister  Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future. </s> <s>  The  opening of the airport was negotiated during last month's U.S. </s> <s> -sponsored  Mideast summit near Washington. </s> <s>  As part of the accord, Israel also  withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released 250  Palestinian prisoners. </s> <s>  A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza  and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations  on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing. </s> <s>  Gaza International,  with the call letters LVGZ, was designed in an Oriental style with  graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco. </s> <s>  The airport  has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long  runway. </s> <s>  A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control  tower wall. </s> <s>  Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one  Boeing 727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia  next week. </s> <s>  In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely  on some improvisation. </s> <s>  Major pieces of equipment, including the controls  for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod. </s> <s>   Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable control  panel installed in a van. </s> <s>  Despite its temporary shortcomings, many  Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence. </s> <s>   For those living in the small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed  by the Mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire on the other three,  it may help ease the feeling of being trapped. </s> <s>  Now we will be able  to travel without the Israeli procedures that we usually must go through,  said Khaled Salmeh, who studies economics at Gaza City University  and plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Palestinians celebrate opening of Gaza International Airport. </s> </p> </d>
