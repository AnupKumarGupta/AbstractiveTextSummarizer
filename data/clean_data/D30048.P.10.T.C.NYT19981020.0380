article= <d> <p> <s>  The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of  the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy,  reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2. </s> <s> 2 billion  in August to $16. </s> <s> 77 billion. </s> <s>  That is the widest gap since the government  recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992. </s> <s>  It resulted  from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this  country buys from abroad. </s> <s>  So far this year, the trade deficit is running  roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected  $170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. </s> <s>   One senior administration official who deals with economic issues,  speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projections  suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a  figure that he said will certainly cut into growth, and could well  become a major political problem. </s> <s>  Trade deficits carry with them  both good and troubling signals about the economy. </s> <s>  The current flood  of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels  in decades. </s> <s>  And while sales of American aircraft, computer chips and  other goods are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets  in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American  exporters. </s> <s>  But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem  facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some  large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to  make ordinary purchases. </s> <s>  The result is such a freeze of economic activity  that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American piers. </s> <s>   And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers who can  no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen  who are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster has  been ruined by the banking crisis. </s> <s>  Among the most surprising elements  of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit  was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst  effects of the global troubles: China. </s> <s>  Despite continued growth of  the Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and  imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately  seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in  Asia. </s> <s>  That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5. </s> <s> 9 billion,  levels previously only seen in trade with Japan. </s> <s>  The Chinese _ besieged  by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient  banking crisis _ have signaled to the United States in recent weeks  that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets  further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. </s> <s>  That  amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years  has been using the negotiations over China's entry to the world body  as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and  politically. </s> <s>  Ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the  administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's  China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress is  evaporating. </s> <s>  The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American  economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to  lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. </s> <s>  So administration  officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers  as another warning sign, but not a crisis. </s> <s>  While the United States  remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace  continue to strongly influence the U.S. </s> <s>  trade balance, Commerce  Secretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday. </s> <s>  After China,  the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August  came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion  has spread through Latin America. </s> <s>  Exports to Mexico have remained  unchanged. </s> <s>  But imports from Mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly  automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment  _ as American manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening  currency. </s> <s>  In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest  focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary  Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. </s> <s>  Normally, that  would be cited as a sign of continued demand for American products  in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be  imperiled. </s> <s>  The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete  a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help  it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through  Asia, Russia and several other nations. </s> <s>  Tuesday the IMF and Brazil  reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and  next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections  in Brazil this weekend. </s> <s>  But for all these potential problems, the  rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. </s> <s>  Because  the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment  here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and Senate  around the country. </s> <s>  The only exception has been in regions where the  steel industry is strong. </s> <s>  The major steel companies have charged in  recent weeks that Asian nations are dumping products on the American  market at prices well below their costs. </s> <s>  The Commerce Department has  begun an inquiry. </s> <s>  The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the  deficit rose 15. </s> <s> 3 percent to $16. </s> <s> 77 billion in August, up from a revised  figure of $14. </s> <s> 55 billion in July. </s> <s>  The department said that the resumption  of production at General Motors Corp. </s> <s>  after last summer's strike may  have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM brought  in parts from abroad. </s> <s>  The deficit was the highest since the Commerce  Department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. </s> <s>   Exports, the department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about  $74. </s> <s> 8 billion. </s> <s>  Imports rose 2. </s> <s> 2 percent to $91. </s> <s> 6 billion. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> American exports decline as a
