article= <d> <p> <s>  It was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one  of New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the  praises of Sen. </s> <s>  Alfonse M. D'Amato. </s> <s>  Rivera, president of the largest  union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott,  the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health  coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. </s> <s>  It looked  as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato _ or  at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. </s> <s>  Senate race in  New York. </s> <s>  But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the  National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. </s> <s>  Charles  E. Schumer, D-N. </s> <s> Y. </s> <s> , and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. </s> <s>  The endorsement  is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful  senator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions  turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected. </s> <s>  Although it  may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union  backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. </s> <s>  Largely as a result of the Lewinsky  scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will  gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the  Republicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45. </s> <s>  For labor leaders  like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare. </s> <s>   That fear has helped push other New York unions into Schumer's column,  even though D'Amato had long courted them. </s> <s>  Those unions include the  teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37,  an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. </s> <s>  Labor  leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority,  the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently  defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and  cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. </s> <s>  We are worried  about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive  into the next century, Rivera said. </s> <s>  Alarmed that the Democrats will  lose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South  Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. </s> <s>   The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was  based on national considerations. </s> <s>  Unfortunately, the leadership  of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt  Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture  as the Republicans of the Northeast, he said. </s> <s>  They're far more  conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more  pro-business. </s> <s>  We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance  in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats. </s> <s>  Trying to avoid  a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as an effective senator. </s> <s>   The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. </s> <s>  Rivera's union and the  teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New  York. </s> <s>  In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the  local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000  political calls a day. </s> <s>  A spokesman for D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's  proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals,  representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue  his efforts on behalf of working middle class families. </s> <s>  His labor  endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association  and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. </s> <s>  Besides  the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's  parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has  350,000 members in New York State. </s> <s>  Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato  the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the  founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees  union. </s> <s>  The convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aims to  make the service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing  together a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative  strategy. </s> <s>  Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees,  and as part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service employees  in New York State. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Labor Union support major factor in D'Amato Schumer Senate race. </s> </p> </d>
