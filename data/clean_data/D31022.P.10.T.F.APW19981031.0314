article= <d> <p> <s>  A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities  got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers,  delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured  162, officials said Saturday. </s> <s>  Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency  services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took  three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where  to send fire trucks. </s> <s>  The first fire trucks and rescue squads were  on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said  at a news conference. </s> <s>  He and other officials declined to comment on  whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant  victims. </s> <s>  The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the  terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they  saw as a slow and even obstructive response. </s> <s>  No help. </s> <s>  No police. </s> <s>   No firemen, 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockeys at  the bash, said Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. </s> <s>  Just kids  helping kids. </s> <s>  And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked  from helping, they say. </s> <s>  We could have saved more young people if  only police hadn't stopped us, Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying  by the newspaper Expressen. </s> <s>  On Saturday, hundreds of people stood  quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they  attempted to come to grips with catastrophe. </s> <s>  In the parking lot that  a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners  had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles  and cards of remembrance. </s> <s>  The cards' inscriptions were brief _ I  will see you in heaven, We miss you _ and the people who stood  reading them also had few words. </s> <s>  I just wanted to show my sympathy. </s> <s>   I think about them. </s> <s>  There's nothing else we can do, said Caroline  Ericsson, who didn't know any of the victims. </s> <s>  For Lasse Gustavsson,  having the right words wasn't as important as showing his face, severely  disfigured in a fire. </s> <s>  The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ears,  his eyelids and most of his nose in a gas explosion. </s> <s>  By showing up,  he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives and friends that  spirit can help them pull through despair. </s> <s>  I can't give them hope. </s> <s>   Consolation is enough, he said, as people nearby cast uneasy glances  at his scars. </s> <s>  Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure  similar shocked looks the rest of their lives. </s> <s>  Authorities say the  explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded hall  to 600 degrees (1,100 F). </s> <s>  The cause of the fire that broke out just  before midnight Thursday remains under investigation. </s> <s>  Witness accounts  have varied widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar  and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the  dance hall on the building's second floor. </s> <s>  The fire's quick spread  has prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials  also say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had  been burning undetected for some time. </s> <s>  What's known is that the hall  was packed far beyond its capacity. </s> <s>  Licensed to hold a maximum of  150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the  fire hit. </s> <s>  The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or  children of immigrant parents. </s> <s>  They had come for a dance organized  by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hall  was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrant association. </s> <s>   Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including  Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people  from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American  countries. </s> <s>  Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing  relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for hours  at hospitals. </s> <s>  Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday. </s> <s>   The identification is hard because they have no driver's licenses  or other documents _ they were so young, said Kerstin Einarsson  of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 residents  about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Stockholm. </s> <s>  The worst previous  Swedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when  20 people died in a hotel fire. </s> </p> </d>	abstract= <d> <p> <s> Alarm call in poor Swedish hard to understand. </s> <s>  Explosive fire. </s> <s> . </s> </p> </d>
